## @james2000nitrogen

* N2^15 is used to test for nitrogen fixation, but as of 2000, studies have been too long to differentiate between free living N fixers decomposing and symbionts.



`r link_pdf("singer2016high")`

Surveyed oomycete diversity in acidic peat bogs in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland and France using Illumina HiSeq sequencing of V9 SSU using universal primers [@amaral2009method].
The MoBio soil kit was used to extract DNA from 65 samples of Sphagenum moss from differnt micohabitats. 3% of the total sequencing was oomycetes and an average of about 16 phylotypes per sample were found constituting a total of 34, although only 3 phylotypes matched their refernece sequence 100%.
There was no significant difference between the 5 sites sampled, but there was a difference between microhabitates, particulary between pools and the more terrestrial ones.
Most of the oomycetes they found were assinged to uncharacterized basal clades. They found some realted to pathogens of animals and plants, but its hard to infer ecosystem function from a 180bp barcode.  


## @lara2011highly 

Used cloneing and sequencing to explore the diversity of protists in sphagenum-dominated bogs and poor fens in the Jura Mountains.
5 water samples yeilded 1070 sequences and 132 phylotypes.
Two SSU primer pairs were used and had different results: 1F/1498R and 82F/1498R.
500ml of water was filtered through 50uM and 0.2uM and DNA was extracted from the 0.2uM filter.
Used phylogenetic methods to analyze community relationships and found evidence for new eukaryotic clade.
Chrysophyaceae was common, particulary in the winter. 


## @rodriguez2015role 

Nitrogen and phosphorous are typically limiting and can be made accessible by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) respectively. 
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are being actively used, but the use of AMF is hampered by insufficient research on yield effects and the need of plants for large-scale culturing of AMF.
Research comparing inoculated vs sterile soil demonstrate a large benefit of AMF, but since AMF are associated with all crop plants naturally, this is rather artificial, and effects of AMF inoculation of plants with existing AMF communities are less consistent.
Only cassava has shown a significant and consistent yield increase of ~20%.
More research on how AMF inoculations affect natural communities is needed. 
There is little evidence on how specific AMF are to host and environment or how quickly they can adapt.
Different isolates of the same AMF species can have drastically different effects of crop yield.
There is also evidence to a lesser degree that host genotype has a significant effect as well. 
More research is needed on the persistence/spread of introduced AMF populations in agriculture systems as well as spread of introduced alleles to native populations. 


## @links2014simultaneous

Many OTUs were shared between brassica and triticum seeds and there was no detectable difference in richness or evenesss. This semms odd considering one is monocot and one a dicot. Perhaps this is due to them being commonly grown in a crop rotation.

?Hierarchical clustering

An antagonistic reaction was found between pantoea agglomerans, a bacterial biocontrol of fireblight, and an Alternaria species, a ascomycete plant pathogen.

chaperonin 60 (cpn60) also called heat schock protein 60 (hsp60) was used as the barcode since it is present in both bcateria and fungi.

## @mengual2014microbial

* Rhizobacteria are known to increase root surface area, nitrogen fixation, and phosphate and potassium availability.
* Found increased lavender growth in response to sugar beet compost and various bacillus species. 
* Addressing the issue of revegitating degraded mediterranian soils.

## @turner2013plant

* Has lots of good things to say about the microbiome
* 5-20% total photosynthesis production goes to rhizobiome
* archea in agriculture contribute to ammonia oxidation and methanogensis
* rhizobium forms nodules on legumes
* azotobacter is a free living N-fixer
* actinomycetes tend to produce antimicrobials 
* bcateria in the phylosphere might have photosynthetic rhodopisins with non-overlappping spetra
* endophytes are mostly in the apoplast and dead cells
* there are more endophytes in lower roots than shoots, perhaps suggesting that they travel upwards.
* the microbiome can increase systemic resistance in plants
* Some bacteria like rhizobia and bacillus can produce plant hormones. 
* Rhizobia is a lifestyle, rhizobium is a genuss

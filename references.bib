This paper quantifies the difficulty of jointly finding the division of samples to species and estimating a species tree without constraining the possible assignments a priori. It introduces a parametric and a nonparametric method, including new heuristic search strategies, to do this delimitation and tree inference using individual gene trees as input. The new methods were evaluated using thousands of simulations and 4 empirical data sets. These analyses suggest that the new methods, especially the nonparametric one, may provide useful insights for systematists working at the species level with molecular data. However, they still often return incorrect results.},

Until recently, it had not been possible to cost-effectively assess mycorrhizas precisely and accurately. A large-scale survey of {ICP} Forests plots would be only the first stage in answering many of the questions outlined above, but it is essential if future studies are going to address these questions with hypothesis-driven research in a cohesive manner, rather than remain independent for lack of a unified approach. The chance to utilise the vast network of biomonitoring plots at this time is a remarkable opportunity because it minimises the logistics and costs associated with achieving such an enormous effort and provides a rare stable — past and future — ground for forest ecosystem scientific investigation. In the face of rapid global change, we finally have an opportunity to accurately integrate mycorrhizal distribution data with long-term environmental monitoring, providing a basic understanding of functionally crucial organisms, and at the same time creating an invaluable resource for future research.},

A hand-curated {ITS}-{LSU} training set of 1,091 sequences and a larger training set of 8,967 {ITS} region sequences were used. Of the factors evaluated, database composition and quality had the largest effect on classification accuracy, followed by fragment size and use of a bootstrap cutoff to improve classification confidence. The naive Bayesian classifier and {BLASTN} gave similar results at higher taxonomic levels, but the classifier was faster and more accurate at the genus level when a bootstrap cutoff was used. All of the {ITS} and {LSU} sections performed well ({\textgreater}97.7\% accuracy) at higher taxonomic ranks from kingdom to family, and differences between them were small at the genus level (within 0.66 to 1.23\%). When full-length sequence sections were used, the {LSU} outperformed the {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 fragments at the genus level, but the {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 showed higher accuracy when smaller fragment sizes of the same length and a 50\% bootstrap cutoff were used. In a comparison using the larger {ITS} training set, {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 had very similar accuracy classification for fragments between 100 and 200 bp. Collectively, the results show that any of the {ITS} or {LSU} sections we tested provided comparable classification accuracy to the genus level and underscore the need for larger and more diverse classification training sets.},

In amplicon pyrosequencing studies of fungal diversity, one of the spacers {ITS}1 or {ITS}2 of the {ITS} region is normally used. In this methodological study we evaluate the usability of {ITS}1 vs. {ITS}2 as a {DNA} metabarcoding marker for fungi. We analyse three data sets: two comprising {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 sequences of known taxonomic affiliations and a third comprising {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 environmental amplicon pyrosequencing data. Clustering analyses of sequences with known taxonomy using the bioinformatics pipeline {ClustEx} revealed that a 97\% similarity cut-off represent a reasonable threshold for estimating the number of known species in the data sets for both {ITS}1 and {ITS}2. However, no single threshold value worked well for all fungi at the same time within the curated {UNITE} database, and we found that the Operational Taxonomic Unit ({OTU}) concept is not easily translated into the level of species because many species are distributed over several clusters. Clustering analyses of the 134 692 {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 pyrosequences using a 97\% similarity cut-off revealed a high similarity between the two data sets when it comes to taxonomic coverage. Although some groups are under- or unrepresented in the two data sets due to, e.g. primer mismatches, our results indicate that {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 to a large extent yield similar results when used as {DNA} metabarcodes for fungi.},

During a 12-month study, there were 1.8 episodes of A. baumannii bacteremia per 1,000 adults admitted to a hospital in Seville, Spain. Seventy-nine patients were included in the study. A. baumannii bacteremia occurred after a mean (± {SD}) hospitalization of 18 ± 20 days. In all cases the infections were acquired nosocomially; 71\% were acquired in intensive care units. Ampicillinl sulbactam was found to be the most active agent against A. baumannii. The most common source of the bacteremia was the respiratory tract (32 cases [71\%n. Twenty patients (25\%) had septic shock, and 24 (30\%) had disseminated intravascular coagulation ({DIC}). Treatment with imipenem or ampicillinlsulbactam was most effective (cure rates, 87.5\% and 83\%, respectively). The deaths of 27 patients (34\%) were related to A. baumannii bacteremia. The presence of {DIC} (odds ratio [{OR}] = 116.4; P {\textless} .0001) and inappropriate antimicrobial treatment ({OR} = 15.2; P {\textless} .01) were independently associated with mortality. We conclude that most A. baumannii isolates are multiresistant and that nosocomial A. baumannii bacteremia may cause severe clinical disease that is associated with a high mortality.},

	abstract = {Sequencing of ribosomal {DNA} clone libraries amplified from environmental {DNA} has revolutionized our understanding of microbial eukaryote diversity and ecology. The results of these analyses have shown that protist groups are far more genetically heterogeneous than their morphological diversity suggests. However, the clone library approach is labour-intensive, relatively expensive, and methodologically biased. Therefore, even the most intensive {rDNA} library analyses have recovered only small samples of much larger assemblages, indicating that global environments harbour a vast array of unexplored biodiversity. High-throughput parallel tag 454 sequencing offers an unprecedented scale of sampling for molecular detection of microbial diversity. Here, we report a 454 protocol for sampling and characterizing assemblages of eukaryote microbes. We use this approach to sequence two {SSU} {rDNA} diversity markers—the variable V4 and V9 regions—from 10 L of anoxic Norwegian fjord water. We identified 38 116 V4 and 15 156 V9 unique sequences. Both markers detect a wide range of taxonomic groups but in both cases the diversity detected was dominated by dinoflagellates and close relatives. Long-tailed rank abundance curves suggest that the 454 sequencing approach provides improved access to rare genotypes. Most tags detected represent genotypes not currently in {GenBank}, although many are similar to database sequences. We suggest that current understanding of the ecological complexity of protist communities, genetic diversity, and global species richness are severely limited by the sequence data hitherto available, and we discuss the biological significance of this high amplicon diversity.},

Polymyxin antibiotics such as colistin have resurfaced as effective last-resort antimicrobials for use against {MDR} Gram-negative pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii. Here we show that A. baumannii can rapidly develop resistance to polymyxin antibiotics by complete loss of the initial binding target, the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), which has long been considered to be essential for the viability of Gram-negative bacteria. We characterized 13 independent colistin-resistant derivatives of A. baumannii type strain {ATCC} 19606 and showed that all contained mutations within one of the first three genes of the lipid A biosynthesis pathway: {lpxA}, {lpxC}, and {lpxD}. All of these mutations resulted in the complete loss of {LPS} production. Furthermore, we showed that loss of {LPS} occurs in a colistin-resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii.

The availability of next-generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists’ need for high-throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of {DNA} metabarcoding. The potential power of {DNA} metabarcoding as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on {PCR} and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries. Further developments associated with the impressive progress in {DNA} sequencing will eliminate the currently required {DNA} amplification step, and comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries composed of whole organellar genomes and repetitive ribosomal nuclear {DNA} can be built based on the well-curated {DNA} extract collections maintained by standardized barcoding initiatives.

Hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational taxonomic units, the basis for many downstream analyses. Most existing algorithms have quadratic space and computational complexities, and thus can be used only for small or medium-scale problems. We propose a new online learning-based algorithm that simultaneously addresses the space and computational issues of prior work. The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of subspaces using a partition tree constructed using a pseudometric, then recursively refine a clustering structure in these subspaces. The technique relies on new methods for fast closest-pair searching and efficient dynamic insertion and deletion of tree nodes. To avoid exhaustive computation of pairwise distances between clusters, we represent each cluster of sequences as a probabilistic sequence, and define a set of operations to align these probabilistic sequences and compute genetic distances between them. We present analyses of space and computational complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm using a human gut microbiota data set with over one million sequences. The new algorithm exhibits a quasilinear time and space complexity comparable to greedy heuristic clustering algorithms, while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

	abstract = {Protists are ubiquitous members of soil microbial communities, but the structure of these communities, and the factors that influence their diversity, are poorly understood. We used barcoded pyrosequencing to survey comprehensively the diversity of soil protists from 40 sites across a broad geographic range that represent a variety of biome types, from tropical forests to deserts. In addition to taxa known to be dominant in soil, including Cercozoa and Ciliophora, we found high relative abundances of groups such as Apicomplexa and Dinophyceae that have not previously been recognized as being important components of soil microbial communities. Soil protistan communities were highly diverse, approaching the extreme diversity of their bacterial counterparts across the same sites. Like bacterial taxa, protistan taxa were not globally distributed, and the composition of these communities diverged considerably across large geographic distances. However, soil protistan and bacterial communities exhibit very different global-scale biogeographical patterns, with protistan communities strongly structured by climatic conditions that regulate annual soil moisture availability.},

	abstract = {Projected temperature increases under global warming could benefit southern tree species by providing them the optimal growing temperature and could be detrimental to northern species by exposing them to the supra optimal growing temperatures. This benefit-detriment trade-off could increase the competitive advantage of southern species in the northern species range and cause the increase or even dominance of southern species in the northern domain. However, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of C3 plants may increase due to {CO}2 enrichment. An increase in the optimum temperature could greatly reduce the benefit-detriment effect. In this study, we coupled a forest ecosystem process model ({PnET}-{II}) and a forest {GAP} model ({LINKAGES}) with a spatially dynamic forest landscape model ({LANDIS}-{II}) to study how an optimum temperature increase could affect forest landscape response due to global warming. We simulated 360 years of forest landscape change in the Boundary Water Canoe Area ({BWCA}) in northern Minnesota, which is transitional between boreal and temperate forest. Our results showed that, under the control scenario of continuing the historic 1984–1993 mean climate (mainly temperature, precipitation and {CO}2), the {BWCA} will become a spruce-fir dominated boreal forest. However, under the scenario of predicted climatic change [the 2000–2099 climates are predicted by Canadian Climate Center ({CCC}), followed by 200 years of continuing the predicted 2090–2099 mean climate], the {BWCA} will become a pine-dominated mixed forest. If the optimum temperature increases gradually with [{CO}2] (the increase in optimum temperature is assumed to change gradually from 0 °C in year 2000 to 5 °C in year 2099 when [{CO}2] reaches 711 ppm and stabilizes at 5 °C after year 2099), the {BWCA} would remain a fir-dominated boreal forest in areas with relatively high water-holding capacity, but not in areas with relatively low water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the [{CO}2] induced increases in optimum temperature could substantially reduce forest landscape change caused by global warming. However, not all tree species would be able to successfully adapt to future warming as predicted by {CCC}, regardless of optimum temperature acclimations.},

In this article, we review our current understanding of the role of microorganisms in coral health and disease, and highlight the pressing interdisciplinary research priorities required to elucidate the mechanisms of disease. We advocate an approach that applies knowledge gained from experiences in human and veterinary medicine, integrated into multidisciplinary studies that investigate the interactions between host, agent and environment of a given coral disease. These approaches include robust and precise disease diagnosis, standardised ecological methods and application of rapidly developing {DNA}, {RNA} and protein technologies, alongside established histological, microbial ecology and ecological expertise.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a high-throughput method to identify and discriminate the clinically important S. aureus capsular serotypes 5, 8, and {NT} (nontypeable). A comprehensive set of clinical isolates derived from different origins and control strains, representative for each serotype, were used to establish a {CP} typing system based on Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopy and chemometric techniques. By combining {FTIR} spectroscopy with artificial neuronal network ({ANN}) analysis, a system was successfully established, allowing a rapid identification and discrimination of all three serotypes. The overall accuracy of the {ANN}-assisted {FTIR} spectroscopy {CP} typing system was 96.7\% for the internal validation and 98.2\% for the external validation. One isolate in the internal validation and one isolate in the external validation failed in the classification procedure, but none of the isolates was incorrectly classified. The present study demonstrates that {ANN}-assisted {FTIR} spectroscopy allows a rapid and reliable discrimination of S. aureus capsular serotypes. It is suitable for diagnostic as well as large-scale epidemiologic surveillance of S. aureus capsule expression and provides useful information with respect to chronicity of infection.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}) of {DNA} is a simple, cost effective, and rapid method for the specific detection of genomic {DNA} using a set of six oligonucleotide primers with eight binding sites hybridizing specifically to different regions of a target gene, and a thermophilic {DNA} polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus for {DNA} amplification. The method has been applied in various assays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections of humans and animals, sexing of bovine and swine embryos, and in the detection of bacteria from environmental samples. Only recently, first applications for fungal organisms were published. During the current study a {LAMP} assay was developed for the specific detection of Fusarium graminearum, the major causative agent of Fusarium head blight of small cereals and producer of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and zearalenone. The assay was based on the {gaoA} gene (galactose oxidase) of the fungus. Amplification of {DNA} during the reaction was indirectly detected in situ by using calcein fluorescence as a marker without the necessity of time-consuming electrophoretic analysis. The assay was optimized for rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity and was shown to detect the presence of less than 2 pg of purified target {DNA} per reaction within 30 min. Within 132 fungal species tested, exclusively {DNA} isolated from cultures of F. graminearum (lineages 1–9) resulted in a fluorescent signal after amplification with the {LAMP} assay. The method was demonstrated to be useful in the analysis of fungal cultures by direct analysis of surface scrapings from agar plate cultures, direct testing of single infected barley grains, and detection of F. graminearum in total genomic {DNA} isolated from bulk samples of ground wheat grains. Results obtained indicate that {LAMP} offers an interesting new assay format for the rapid and specific {DNA}-based detection and identification of agriculturally important toxigenic fungi in pure cultures and in contaminated sample materials and therefore presents an alternative to {PCR}-based assays.},

New species delimitation methods ({SDMs}) can accommodate nonmonophyletic species and gene tree discordance as a result of incomplete lineage sorting via the coalescent model, but do not explicitly accommodate gene flow after divergence. Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) can incorporate gene flow and estimate other relevant parameters of the speciation process while testing alternative species delimitation hypotheses. We evaluated the accuracy of {BPP}, {SpeDeSTEM}, and {ABC} for delimiting species using simulated data and applied these methods to empirical data from lizards of the Liolaemus darwinii complex. Overall, {BPP} was the most accurate, {ABC} showed an intermediate accuracy, and {SpeDeSTEM} was the least accurate under most simulated conditions. All three {SDMs} showed lower accuracy when speciation occurred despite gene flow, as found in previous studies, but {ABC} was the method with the smallest decrease in accuracy. All three {SDMs} consistently supported the distinctness of southern and northern lineages within L. darwinii.

	abstract = {Oomycete species occupy many different environments and many ecological niches. The genera Phytophthora and Pythium for example, contain many plant pathogens which cause enormous damage to a wide range of plant species. Proper identification to the species level is a critical first step in any investigation of oomycetes, whether it is research driven or compelled by the need for rapid and accurate diagnostics during a pathogen outbreak. The use of {DNA} for oomycete species identification is well established, but {DNA} barcoding with cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ({COI}) is a relatively new approach that has yet to be assessed over a significant sample of oomycete genera. In this study we have sequenced {COI}, from 1205 isolates representing 23 genera. A comparison to internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) sequences from the same isolates showed that {COI} identification is a practical option; complementary because it uses the mitochondrial genome instead of nuclear {DNA}. In some cases {COI} was more discriminative than {ITS} at the species level. This is in contrast to the large ribosomal subunit, which showed poor species resolution when sequenced from a subset of the isolates used in this study. The results described in this paper indicate that {COI} sequencing and the dataset generated are a valuable addition to the currently available oomycete taxonomy resources, and that both {COI}, the default {DNA} barcode supported by {GenBank}, and {ITS}, the de facto barcode accepted by the oomycete and mycology community, are acceptable and complementary {DNA} barcodes to be used for identification of oomycetes.},

Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify metabolic and taxonomic shifts in microbial communities associated with the hard coral Acropora millepora throughout a natural thermal bleaching event at Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef). A direct comparison of metagenomic data sets from healthy versus bleached corals indicated major shifts in microbial associates during heat stress, including Bacteria, Archaea, viruses, Fungi and micro-algae. Overall, metabolism of the microbial community shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy, including increases in genes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, proteins, simple carbohydrates, phosphorus and sulfur. In addition, the proportion of virulence genes was higher in the bleached library, indicating an increase in microorganisms capable of pathogenesis following bleaching. These results demonstrate that thermal stress results in shifts in coral-associated microbial communities that may lead to deteriorating coral health.},

Our method operates under the assumption that a priori information regarding group membership is available, for example that samples are drawn from some number of described subspecies, races or distinct morphotypes. {SpedeSTEM} proceeds by calculating the maximum likelihood species tree from all hierarchical arrangements of the sampled alleles and uses information theory to quantify the model probability of each permutation. {SpedeSTEM} is tested here against empirical and simulated data; results indicate that evolutionary lineages that diverged as few as 0.5N generations in the past can be validated as distinct using sequence data from little as five loci. This work enables speciation investigations to identify lineages that are evolutionarily distinct and thus have the potential to form new species before these lineages acquire secondary characteristics such as reproductive isolation or morphological differentiation that are commonly used to define species.},

	abstract = {Rock textures commonly preserve a record of the near-surface crystallization history of volcanic rocks. Under conditions of simple cooling without convection or mixing, textures will reflect sample cooling rate, the temperature at which crystallization was initiated, and the distribution of mineral phase precipitation across the crystallization interval. Compilation of plagioclase size and number density data on natural (dike, sill and lava lake) and experimental samples suggests that (1) growth and nucleation rates of plagioclase in natural basaltic samples are a predictable function of cooling rate, and (2) the observed crystallization rate dependence on cooling rate is similar to that observed in experiments initiated at subliquidus temperatures. Comparison of natural and experimental samples thus suggests that most basalts crystallize under conditions of heterogeneous nucleation, with the number density of preexisting nucleii partially controlling textural responses to cooling rate changes. Time scales of crystallization and cooling in magmatic systems are intimately linked through a balance between heat removal from the system and heat evolved through crystallization. Evaluation of textural data in the context of recent numerical models of crystallization in simple (one- and two-component systems) provides new insight into regularities in the crystallization behavior of basaltic magmas. For example, the rate of change in crystal size (and number density, as dictated by mass balance) has been used as a measure of the relative importance of time scales of crystallization and cooling in numerical models of crystallizing systems. In natural samples, plagioclase size scales with the length scale of cooling such that a logarithmic plot of grain size as a function of normalized distance across the dike has a slope that appears approximately independent of dike width (solidification time). Comparison with available textural data for other phenocryst phases suggests that the same may be true for pyroxene and magnetite crystallization, with each phase having a characteristic slope probably controlled by the thermodynamic properties of the crystallizing phase. Measured crystal size distributions are unimodal and show maximum frequencies in the smaller size classes; distributions broaden and the grain size at peak frequency increases with increasing crystallization times (decreasing cooling rates). In contrast, partially crystallized Makaopuhi lava lake samples have crystal size distributions that decrease exponentially with increasing crystal size. Measured size distributions in dikes can be explained by late stage modification of Makaopuhi-type distributions through loss of small crystals, possibly the consequence of growth without nucleation. Finally, this compilation of the textural response of basaltic magmas to changes in cooling rate suggests that empirical calibrations of crystallization rate dependence on cooling rate from natural samples provide a reasonable model for plagioclase crystallization in near-surface basaltic systems. Predicted growth rates will be slow and relatively constant (10 -10 –10 -11 cm/s) for crystallization times expected in most shallow volcanic systems (\&lt;1000 years).},

Using barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing at 13 sites (10 trees/site; 10 leaves/tree), we found very high levels of diversity within sites (a mean of 551 ± 134 taxonomic units per site). However, among-site diversity contributed even more than did within-site diversity to the overall richness of more than 4,200 taxonomic units observed in M. polymorpha, and this among-site variation in endophyte community composition correlated strongly with temperature and rainfall. These results are consistent with suggestions that foliar endophytic fungi are hyperdiverse. They further suggest that microbial diversity may be even greater than has been assumed and that broad-scale environmental controls such as temperature and rainfall can structure eukaryotic microbial diversity. Appropriately constrained study systems across strong environmental gradients present a useful means to understand the environmental factors that structure the diversity of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases are driving significant changes in global climate. To project potential vegetation response to future climate change, this study uses response surfaces to describe the relationship between bioclimatic variables and the distribution of tree and shrub taxa in western North America. The response surfaces illustrate the probability of the occurrence of a taxon at particular points in climate space. Climate space was defined using three bioclimatic variables: mean temperature of the coldest month, growing degree days, and a moisture index. Species distributions were simulated under present climate using observed data (1951–80, 30-year mean) and under future climate (2090–99, 10-year mean) using scenarios generated by three general circulation models—{HADCM}2, {CGCM}1, and {CSIRO}. The scenarios assume a 1\% per year compound increase in greenhouse gases and changes in sulfate ({SO} 4 ) aerosols based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) {IS}92a scenario. The results indicate that under future climate conditions, potential range changes could be large for many tree and shrub taxa. Shifts in the potential ranges of species are simulated to occur not only northward but in all directions, including southward of the existing ranges of certain species. The simulated potential distributions of some species become increasingly fragmented under the future climate scenarios, while the simulated potential distributions of other species expand. The magnitudes of the simulated range changes imply significant impacts to ecosystems and shifts in patterns of species diversity in western North America.},

Two problems are particularly acute in the pursuit of satisfactory taxonomic assignment of newly generated {ITS} sequences: (i) the lack of an inclusive, reliable public reference data set and (ii) the lack of means to refer to fungal species, for which no Latin name is available in a standardized stable way. Here, we report on progress in these regards through further development of the {UNITE} database (http://unite.ut.ee) for molecular identification of fungi. All fungal species represented by at least two {ITS} sequences in the international nucleotide sequence databases are now given a unique, stable name of the accession number type (e.g. Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus{\textbar}{GU}586904{\textbar}{SH}133781.05FU), and their taxonomic and ecological annotations were corrected as far as possible through a distributed, third-party annotation effort. We introduce the term ‘species hypothesis’ ({SH}) for the taxa discovered in clustering on different similarity thresholds (97–99\%). An automatically or manually designated sequence is chosen to represent each such {SH}. These reference sequences are released (http://unite.ut.ee/repository.php) for use by the scientific community in, for example, local sequence similarity searches and in the {QIIME} pipeline. The system and the data will be updated automatically as the number of public fungal {ITS} sequences grows. We invite everybody in the position to improve the annotation or metadata associated with their particular fungal lineages of expertise to do so through the new Web-based sequence management system in {UNITE}.},

How trees die during drought over multiple years remains largely unknown and precludes mechanistic modeling and prediction of forest die-off with climate change. Here, we examine the physiological basis of a recent multiyear widespread die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across much of western North America. Using observations from both native trees while they are dying and a rainfall exclusion experiment on mature trees, we measure hydraulic performance over multiple seasons and years and assess pathways of accumulated hydraulic damage. We test whether accumulated hydraulic damage can predict the probability of tree survival over 2 years. We find that hydraulic damage persisted and increased in dying trees over multiple years and exhibited few signs of repair. This accumulated hydraulic deterioration is largely mediated by increased vulnerability to cavitation, a process known as cavitation fatigue. Furthermore, this hydraulic damage predicts the probability of interyear stem mortality. Contrary to the expectation that surviving trees have weathered severe drought, the hydraulic deterioration demonstrated here reveals that surviving regions of these forests are actually more vulnerable to future droughts due to accumulated xylem damage. As the most widespread tree species in North America, increasing vulnerability to drought in these forests has important ramifications for ecosystem stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Our results provide a foundation for incorporating accumulated drought impacts into climate-vegetation models. Finally, our findings highlight the critical role of drought stress accumulation and repair of stress-induced damage for avoiding plant mortality, presenting a dynamic and contingent framework for drought impacts on forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {We document high rates of triploidy in aspen (Populus tremuloides) across the western {USA} (up to 69\% of genets), and ask whether the incidence of triploidy across the species range corresponds with latitude, glacial history (as has been documented in other species), climate, or regional variance in clone size. Using a combination of microsatellite genotyping, flow cytometry, and cytology, we demonstrate that triploidy is highest in unglaciated, drought-prone regions of North America, where the largest clone sizes have been reported for this species. While we cannot completely rule out a low incidence of undetected aneuploidy, tetraploidy or duplicated loci, our evidence suggests that these phenomena are unlikely to be significant contributors to our observed patterns. We suggest that the distribution of triploid aspen is due to a positive synergy between triploidy and ecological factors driving clonality. Although triploids are expected to have low fertility, they are hypothesized to be an evolutionary link to sexual tetraploidy. Thus, interactions between clonality and polyploidy may be a broadly important component of geographic speciation patterns in perennial plants. Further, cytotypes are expected to show physiological and structural differences which may influence susceptibility to ecological factors such as drought, and we suggest that cytotype may be a significant and previously overlooked factor in recent patterns of high aspen mortality in the southwestern portion of the species range. Finally, triploidy should be carefully considered as a source of variance in genomic and ecological studies of aspen, particularly in western U.S. landscapes.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The massive scale of the 1997–1998 El Niño–associated coral bleaching event underscores the need for strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses resulting from temperature-induced coral mortality. As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify ( 1 ) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality ( i.e., areas of natural “resistance” to bleaching ) and ( 2 ) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred ( i.e., areas of natural community “resilience” ). These “target areas,” where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is commonly used in metagenomic studies of complex microbial communities but whether or not different {NGS} platforms recover the same diversity from a sample and their assembled sequences are of comparable quality remain unclear. We compared the two most frequently used platforms, the Roche 454 {FLX} Titanium and the Illumina Genome Analyzer ({GA}) {II}, on the same {DNA} sample obtained from a complex freshwater planktonic community. Despite the substantial differences in read length and sequencing protocols, the platforms provided a comparable view of the community sampled. For instance, derived assemblies overlapped in ∼90\% of their total sequences and in situ abundances of genes and genotypes (estimated based on sequence coverage) correlated highly between the two platforms (R2{\textgreater}0.9). Evaluation of base-call error, frameshift frequency, and contig length suggested that Illumina offered equivalent, if not better, assemblies than Roche 454. The results from metagenomic samples were further validated against {DNA} samples of eighteen isolate genomes, which showed a range of genome sizes and G+C\% content. We also provide quantitative estimates of the errors in gene and contig sequences assembled from datasets characterized by different levels of complexity and G+C\% content. For instance, we noted that homopolymer-associated, single-base errors affected ∼1\% of the protein sequences recovered in Illumina contigs of 10× coverage and 50\% G+C; this frequency increased to ∼3\% when non-homopolymer errors were also considered. Collectively, our results should serve as a useful practical guide for choosing proper sampling strategies and data possessing protocols for future metagenomic studies.},

We introduce {GCTA}'s five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from {SNPs}, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the {SNPs}, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and {GWAS} simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the {SNPs} on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation.

	abstract = {We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different ‘species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a ‘Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant ‘species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of ‘hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful ‘species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant ‘prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful ‘species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of ‘rainy days' and ‘warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the ‘species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.},

This discovery prompted us to examine species boundaries and relationships between members formerly assigned to T. scalpturatum and allied taxa using phylogenetic analyses. Sequence data were obtained from three nuclear {DNA} regions [internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}), gpd and tef], from 101 carpophores collected over a large geographical range in Western Europe, and some reference sequences from public databases. The {ITS} was also tested for its applicability as {DNA} barcode for species delimitation. Four highly supported phylogenetic clades were detected. The two previously detected genetic groups of T. scalpturatum were assigned to the phylospecies Tricholoma argyraceum and T. scalpturatum. The two remaining clades were referred to as Tricholoma cingulatum and Tricholoma inocybeoides. Unexpectedly, T. cingulatum showed an accelerated rate of evolution that we attributed to narrow host specialization. This study also reveals recombinant {ITS} sequences in T. inocybeoides, suggesting a hybrid origin. The {ITS} was a useful tool for the determination of species boundaries: the mean value of intraspecific genetic distances in the entire {ITS} region (including 5.8S {rDNA}) was {\textless}0.2\%, whereas interspecific divergence estimates ranged from 1.78\% to 4.22\%. Apart from giving insights into the evolution of the T. scalpturatum complex, this study contributes to the establishment of a library of taxonomically verified voucher specimens, an a posteriori correlation between phenotype and genotype, and {DNA} barcoding of ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

While these techniques are advantageous, because they do not rely on the need to culture organisms, each technique may have its own biases and/or limitations when used to assess fungal diversity from mixed-template samples. In this study, we analyzed {PCR} specificity and efficiency of the {ITS} primers ({ITS}1F and {ITS}4) in a series of single- and mixed-template samples using a combined quantitative {PCR}–length heterogeneity analysis ({LH}-{qPCR}) approach. As expected, these primers successfully amplified all higher fungal species tested (10 ascomycetes, 6 basidiomycetes, and 4 zygomycetes) and no members of the oomycetes. Based on our results, and a search of the {GenBank} database, amplicons of the {ITS}1F and {ITS}4 primer set exhibit considerable variability (420 to 825 bp), but due to similarities in amplicon sizes of some fungal species, actual species diversity in environmental samples may be underestimated approximately two-fold. The addition of an initial {qPCR} step allowed for the accurate quantitation of total fungal {DNA} in mixed-template samples over five orders of magnitude (10− 1 to 103 pg μl− 1). {PCR} biases between individuals in mixed-templates rendered it impossible to determine the absolute quantity of any individual within a population from its individual peak height. However, relative changes in individuals within a mixed-template sample could be determined due to a constant proportionality between peak heights and starting template concentration. Variability associated with the individual steps of the {LH}-{qPCR} analysis was also determined from environmental samples.},

	abstract = {Microbes commonly exist in milieus of varying complexity and diversity. Although cultivation-based techniques have been unable to accurately capture the true diversity within microbial communities, these deficiencies have been overcome by applying molecular approaches that target the universally conserved 16S ribosomal {RNA} gene. The recent application of 454 pyrosequencing to simultaneously sequence thousands of 16S {rDNA} sequences (pyrotags) has revolutionized the characterization of complex microbial communities. To date, studies based on 454 pyrotags have dominated the field, but sequencing platforms that generate many more sequence reads at much lower costs have been developed. Here, we use the Illumina sequencing platform to design a strategy for 16S amplicon analysis ({iTags}), and assess its generality, practicality and potential complications. We fabricated and sequenced paired-end libraries of amplified hyper-variable 16S {rDNA} fragments from sets of samples that varied in their contents, ranging from a single bacterium to highly complex communities. We adopted an approach that allowed us to evaluate several potential sources of errors, including sequencing artifacts, amplification biases, non-corresponding paired-end reads and mistakes in taxonomic classification. By considering each source of error, we delineate ways to make biologically relevant and robust conclusions from the millions of sequencing reads that can be readily generated by this technology.},

	abstract = {Molecular sequencing has helped resolve the phylogenetic relationships amongst the diverse groups of algal, fungal-like and protist organisms that constitute the Chromalveolate “superkingdom” clade. It is thought that the whole clade evolved from a photosynthetic ancestor and that there have been at least three independent plastid losses during their evolutionary history. The fungal-like oomycetes and hyphochytrids, together with the marine flagellates Pirsonia and Developayella, form part of the clade defined by Cavalier-Smith and Chao (2006) as the phylum “Pseudofungi”, which is a sister to the photosynthetic chromistan algae (phylum Ochrophyta). Within the oomycetes, a number of predominantly marine holocarpic genera appear to diverge before the main “saprolegnian” and “peronosporalean” lines, into which all oomycetes had been traditionally placed. It is now clear that oomycetes have their evolutionary roots in the sea. The earliest diverging oomycete genera so far documented, Eurychasma and Haptoglossa, are both obligate parasites that show a high degree of complexity and sophistication in their host parasite interactions and infection structures. Key morphological and cytological features of the oomycetes will be reviewed in the context of our revised understanding of their likely phylogeny. Recent genomic studies have revealed a number of intriguing similarities in host–pathogen interactions between the oomycetes with their distant apicocomplexan cousins. Therefore, the earlier view that oomycetes evolved from the largely saprotrophic “saprolegnian line” is not supported and current evidence shows these organisms evolved from simple holocarpic marine parasites. Both the hyphal-like pattern of growth and the acquisition of oogamous sexual reproduction probably developed largely after the migration of these organisms from the sea to land.},

A major goal of these studies is the identification of important groups of microorganisms that vary according to physiological or disease states in the host, but the incidence of rare taxa and the large numbers of taxa observed make that goal difficult to obtain using traditional approaches. Fortunately, similar problems have been addressed by the machine learning community in other fields of study such as microarray analysis and text classification. In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data. To encourage the development of new approaches to supervised classification of microbiota, we discuss several structures inherent in microbial community data that may be available for exploitation in novel approaches, and we include as supplemental information several benchmark classification tasks for use by the community.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal {RNA} gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the ‘rare biosphere’, is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of 16S {rDNA} amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli {MG}1655 as a reference template, we find that 16S {rDNA} diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

	abstract = {In aspen and other plant species the effects of environment on phenotype are generally better characterized than genotypic influences. Furthermore, little is known about how genetic influences on tree phenotype change over time. We assessed clonal differences in 417 ramets, representing 18 clones, in a common garden of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) that have developed over 27 years. Genetic contributions to variation in physiology, growth, and vigor were determined over seasonal and multidecadal time scales. The 18 aspen clones exhibited wide-ranging phenotypic variation with two- to threefold differences in physiology and growth traits and more than sevenfold differences in canopy decline and mortality. For growth traits, strong genetic correlations (typically greater than 0.70) and heritability (estimates maintained in a range of 0.25 to 0.36), indicate that genotype had a moderate and consistent influence on growth over the three decades of the study. Physiological traits had much lower genetic correlations and heritability estimates, and they changed significantly within a single growing season. Climatic data suggest that dry conditions in the common garden as the summer progressed may have had a controlling influence on physiological trait responses. Characterizing genetically based phenotypic variation and how it contributes to clone vigor provides a critical link to understanding constraints to aspen viability in its western range.},

We analysed range-wide maternally inherited mitochondrial {DNA} and paternally inherited chloroplast {DNA} sequence data with coalescent simulations and traditional population genetic methods to test hypotheses of population divergence generated from the fossil record of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), an ecologically and economically important western North American conifer. Specifically, we tested (i) the hypothesis that the Pliocene orogeny of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada caused the divergence of coastal and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir varieties; and (ii) the hypothesis that multiple glacial refugia existed on the coast and in the Rocky Mountains. We found that Douglas-fir varieties diverged about 2.11 Ma (4.37 Ma–755 ka), which could be consistent with a Pliocene divergence. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir probably resided in three or more glacial refugia. More variable molecular markers would be required to detect the two coastal refugia suggested in the fossil record. Comparison of mitochondrial {DNA} and chloroplast {DNA} variation revealed that gene flow via pollen linked populations isolated from seed exchange. Postglacial colonization of Canada from coastal and Rocky Mountain refugia near the ice margin at the Last Glacial Maximum produced a wide hybrid zone among varieties that formed almost exclusively by pollen exchange and chloroplast {DNA} introgression, not seed exchange. Postglacial migration rates were 50–165 m/year, insufficient to track projected 21st century warming in some regions. Although fossil and genetic data largely agree, each provides unique insights.},

The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the {SILVA} 16S/18S {rDNA} non-redundant reference dataset ({SSURef} 108 {NR}). Based on this evaluation a selection of ‘best available’ primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100–400, 400–1000, ≥1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S {rDNA} amplicons with 16S {rDNA} fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in {PCR}-based microbial diversity studies.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region of nuclear ribosomal {DNA} is a common marker not only for the molecular identification of different taxa and strains, but also for the analysis of population structure of wild microparasite communities. Importantly, the multicopy nature of this region allows the amplification of low-quantity samples of the target {DNA}, a common problem in studies on unicellular, unculturable microparasites. We analysed {ITS} sequences from the protozoan parasite Caullerya mesnili (class Ichthyosporea) infecting waterflea (Daphnia) hosts, across several host population samples. We showed that analysing representative {ITS}-types [as identified by statistical parsimony network analysis ({SPN})] is a suitable method to address relevant polymorphism. The spatial patterns were consistent regardless of whether parasite {DNA} was extracted from individual hosts or pooled host samples. Remarkably, the efficiency in detecting different sequence types was even higher after sample pooling. As shown by simulations, an easily manageable number of sequences from pooled {DNA} samples are sufficient to resolve the spatial population structure in this system. In summary, the {ITS} region analysed from pooled {DNA} samples can provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of microparasites. Moreover, the application of {SPN} analysis is a good alternative to the well-established neighbour-joining method ({NJ}) for the identification of representative {ITS}-types. {SPN} can even outperform {NJ} by joining most of the singleton sequences to representative sequence clusters.},

	abstract = {Vitamin traffic, the production of organic growth factors by some microbial community members and their use by other taxa, is being scrutinized as a potential explanation for the variation and highly connected behavior observed in ocean plankton by community network analysis. Thiamin (vitamin B1), a cofactor in many essential biochemical reactions that modify carbon–carbon bonds of organic compounds, is distributed in complex patterns at subpicomolar concentrations in the marine surface layer (0–300 m). Sequenced genomes from organisms belonging to the abundant and ubiquitous {SAR}11 clade of marine chemoheterotrophic bacteria contain genes coding for a complete thiamin biosynthetic pathway, except for {thiC}, encoding the 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine ({HMP}) synthase, which is required for de novo synthesis of thiamin’s pyrimidine moiety. Here we demonstrate that the {SAR}11 isolate ‘Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique’, strain {HTCC}1062, is auxotrophic for the thiamin precursor {HMP}, and cannot use exogenous thiamin for growth. In culture, strain {HTCC}1062 required 0.7 zeptomoles per cell (ca. 400 {HMP} molecules per cell). Measurements of dissolved {HMP} in the Sargasso Sea surface layer showed that {HMP} ranged from undetectable (detection limit: 2.4 {pM}) to 35.7 {pM}, with maximum concentrations coincident with the deep chlorophyll maximum. In culture, some marine cyanobacteria, microalgae and bacteria exuded {HMP}, and in the Western Sargasso Sea, {HMP} profiles changed between the morning and evening, suggesting a dynamic biological flux from producers to consumers.},

Coral disease has been a major contributor to this threat, but little is known about the responsible pathogens. To date most research has focused on bacterial and fungal diseases; however, viruses may also be important for coral health. Using a combination of empirical viral metagenomics and real-time {PCR}, we show that Porites compressa corals contain a suite of eukaryotic viruses, many related to the Herpesviridae. This coral-associated viral consortium was found to shift in response to abiotic stressors. In particular, when exposed to reduced {pH}, elevated nutrients, and thermal stress, the abundance of herpes-like viral sequences rapidly increased in 2 separate experiments. Herpes-like viral sequences were rarely detected in apparently healthy corals, but were abundant in a majority of stressed samples. In addition, surveys of the Nematostella and Hydra genomic projects demonstrate that even distantly related Cnidarians contain numerous herpes-like viral genes, likely as a result of latent or endogenous viral infection. These data support the hypotheses that corals experience viral infections, which are exacerbated by stress, and that herpes-like viruses are common in Cnidarians.},

Existing Illumina sequencing protocols are, however, limited by the fraction of the 16S {rRNA} gene that is interrogated and therefore limit the resolution and quality of the profiling. To address this, we present the design of a novel protocol for shotgun Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene, optimized to amplify more than 90\% of sequences in the Greengenes database and with the ability to distinguish nearly twice as many species-level {OTUs} compared to existing protocols. Using several in silico and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that despite the presence of multiple variable and conserved regions, the resulting shotgun sequences can be used to accurately quantify the constituents of complex microbial communities. The reconstruction of a significant fraction of the 16S {rRNA} gene also enabled high precision ({\textgreater}90\%) in species-level identification thereby opening up potential application of this approach for clinical microbial characterization.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Bleaching manifests itself as a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) and/or chlorophyll from a variety of symbiotic hosts, including corals and sea anemones. Bleaching is known to result from a range of environmental stresses, the most significant of which is elevated temperature; how these stresses elicit a bleaching response is currently the focus of intense research. One consequence of environmental stress that has yet to be considered is viral attack. Here, we have isolated a transferable infectious agent believed to be a virus, from zooxanthellae of the temperate sea anemone Anemonia viridis. The infectious agent is induced by elevated temperature. Once induced, the filterable agent can be further propagated without heat induction, thus fulfilling Koch¹s postulates. We propose that zooxanthellae harbor a latent viral infection that is induced by exposure to elevated temperatures. If such a mechanism also operates in the zooxanthellae harbored by reef corals, and these viruses kill the symbionts, then this could contribute to temperature-induced bleaching.},

	abstract = {Eight years after {DNA} barcoding was formally proposed on a large scale, {CO}1 sequences are rapidly accumulating from around the world. While studies to date have mostly targeted local or regional species assemblages, the recent launch of the global {iBOL} project (International Barcode of Life), highlights the need to understand the effects of geographical scale on Barcoding's goals. Sampling has been central in the debate on {DNA} Barcoding, but the effect of the geographical scale of sampling has not yet been thoroughly and explicitly tested with empirical data. Here, we present a {CO}1 data set of aquatic predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Agabini, sampled throughout Europe, and use it to investigate how the geographic scale of sampling affects 1) the estimated intraspecific variation of species, 2) the genetic distance to the most closely related heterospecific, 3) the ratio of intraspecific and interspecific variation, 4) the frequency of taxonomically recognized species found to be monophyletic, and 5) query identification performance based on 6 different species assignment methods. Intraspecific variation was significantly correlated with the geographical scale of sampling (R-square = 0.7), and more than half of the species with 10 or more sampled individuals (N = 29) showed higher intraspecific variation than 1\% sequence divergence. In contrast, the distance to the closest heterospecific showed a significant decrease with increasing geographical scale of sampling. The average genetic distance dropped from {\textgreater} 7\% for samples within 1 km, to {\textless} 3.5\% for samples up to {\textgreater} 6000 km apart. Over a third of the species were not monophyletic, and the proportion increased through locally, nationally, regionally, and continentally restricted subsets of the data. The success of identifying queries decreased with increasing spatial scale of sampling; liberal methods declined from 100\% to around 90\%, whereas strict methods dropped to below 50\% at continental scales. The proportion of query identifications considered uncertain (more than one species {\textless} 1\% distance from query) escalated from zero at local, to 50\% at continental scale. Finally, by resampling the most widely sampled species we show that even if samples are collected to maximize the geographical coverage, up to 70 individuals are required to sample 95\% of intraspecific variation. The results show that the geographical scale of sampling has a critical impact on the global application of {DNA} barcoding. Scale-effects result from the relative importance of different processes determining the composition of regional species assemblages (dispersal and ecological assembly) and global clades (demography, speciation, and extinction). The incorporation of geographical information, where available, will be required to obtain identification rates at global scales equivalent to those in regional barcoding studies. Our result hence provides an impetus for both smarter barcoding tools and sprouting national barcoding initiatives—smaller geographical scales deliver higher accuracy.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

	abstract = {Irrigation water recycling is an increasingly important practice in agriculture in the context of diminishing water supply and the regulatory requirements in some parts of the world. This practice potentially accumulates and disseminates plant pathogens including Phytophthora species that pose a great threat to agriculture and forest ecosystems. Despite a high economic importance of Phytophthora species, the current understanding of their aquatic ecology is very limited. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate the distribution and diversity of Phytophthora species in an irrigation reservoir of a commercial nursery in eastern Virginia over two consecutive winters. Multiple baits were deployed in surface water at a run-off entrance, 20, 40, 60 and 80 m from the entrance and near the pump inlet and at various depths at the 20-m station. Ten different Phytophthora species were detected in this study that included P. citrophthora, P. gonapodyides, P. hydropathica, P. inundata, P. irrigata, P. megasperma, P. pini, P. polonica, P. syringae and P. tropicalis. Phytophthora recovery declined through the winters from November to March. It also declined with distance from the run-off entrance. These results suggest that water decontamination during winter irrigation events is required at this nursery and possibly in the nurseries from the southern part of the United States. The placement of the pump inlet away from run-off entrance may be a viable strategy to reduce the crop health risk.},

Essential features of barcodes include their applicability to a wide spectrum of taxa and their ability to identify even closely related species. Several {DNA} regions have been proposed as barcodes and the region selected strongly influences the output of a study. However, formal comparisons between barcodes remained limited until now. Here we present a standard method for evaluating barcode quality, based on the use of a new bioinformatic tool that performs in silico {PCR} over large databases. We illustrate this approach by comparing the taxonomic coverage and the resolution of several {DNA} regions already proposed for the barcoding of vertebrates. To assess the relationship between in silico and in vitro {PCR}, we also developed specific primers amplifying different species of Felidae, and we tested them using both kinds of {PCR}

However, such studies have generally been confined to greenhouse and plantation systems. Here we analyze microbial communities from the root endophytic and rhizospheric habitats of Populus deltoides in mature natural trees from both upland and bottomland sites in central Tennessee. Community profiling utilized 454 pyrosequencing with separate primers targeting the V4 region for bacterial 16S {rRNA} and the D1/D2 region for fungal 28S {rRNA} genes. Rhizosphere bacteria were dominated by Acidobacteria (31\%) and Alphaproteobacteria (30\%), whereas most endophytes were from the Gammaproteobacteria (54\%) as well as Alphaproteobacteria (23\%). A single Pseudomonas-like operational taxonomic unit ({OTU}) accounted for 34\% of endophytic bacterial sequences. Endophytic bacterial richness was also highly variable and 10-fold lower than in rhizosphere samples originating from the same roots. Fungal rhizosphere and endophyte samples had approximately equal amounts of the Pezizomycotina (40\%), while the Agaricomycotina were more abundant in the rhizosphere (34\%) than endosphere (17\%). Both fungal and bacterial rhizosphere samples were highly clustered compared to the more variable endophyte samples in a {UniFrac} principal coordinates analysis, regardless of upland or bottomland site origin. Hierarchical clustering of {OTU} relative abundance patterns also showed that the most abundant bacterial and fungal {OTUs} tended to be dominant in either the endophyte or rhizosphere samples but not both. Together, these findings demonstrate that root endophytic communities are distinct assemblages rather than opportunistic subsets of the rhizosphere.},

Using a worldwide sample of Alternaria alternata sensu lato, causal agent of citrus brown spot, the evolutionary histories of four nuclear loci including an endo-polygalacturonase gene, two anonymous loci, and one microsatellite flanking region were estimated using the coalescent. Species boundaries were estimated using several approaches including those that incorporate uncertainty in gene genealogies when lineage sorting and non-reciprocal monophyly of gene trees is common.

This cleavage is accompanied by the formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond between the C1 and O6 atoms in the N -acetylmuramic acid residue ({anhMurNAc}). Crystallographic studies at medium resolution revealed that Slt70 is a multi-domain protein consisting of a large ring-shaped alpha-superhelix with on top a catalytic domain, which resembles the fold of goose-type lysozyme. Here we report the crystal structures of native Slt70 and of its complex with a 1,6-anhydromuropeptide solved at nominal resolutions of 1.65 A and 1.90 A, respectively. The high resolution native structure reveals the details on the hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that stabilise the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The building-block of the alpha-superhelix is an "up-down-up-down" four-alpha-helix bundle involving both parallel and antiparallel helix pairs. Stabilisation of the fold is provided through an extensive packing of apolar atoms, mostly from leucine and alanine residues. It lacks, however, an internal consensus sequence that characterises other super-secondary helical folds like the beta-helix in pectate lyase or the (beta-alpha)-helix in the ribonuclease inhibitor. The 1, 6-anhydromuropeptide product binds in a shallow groove adjacent to the peptidoglycan-binding groove of the catalytic domain. The groove is formed by conserved residues at the interface of the catalytic domain and the alpha-superhelix. The structure of the Slt70-1, 6-anhydromuropeptide complex confirms the presence of a specific binding-site for the peptide moieties of the peptidoglycan and it substantiates the notion that Slt70 starts the cleavage reaction at the {anhMurNAc} end of the peptidoglycan.},

	abstract = {Western Oregon is home to native Rhododendron species and is the center for cultivated
Rhododendron production in the United States. These Rhododendron spp. are known to
be infected with fungal endophytes. However, the community structure of these
endophytes in native and cultivated Rhododendron is poorly understood. Our study
targeted the foliar fungal endophyte communities of two native Rhododendron spp. and
two non-native commercially cultivated Rhododendron varieties. Parallel culturedependent
(fungal isolation and identification based on {ITS} sequencing) and cultureindependent
sequencing approaches (metagenomic sequencing of the {ITS} region using
454 pyrosequencing) were employed, and results provided evidence of distinctly different
community structure in each host species. Additionally, results indicated higher diversity
among cultivated and nursery grown Rhododendron. This suggests that the close
proximity of the nurseries sampled to the forest environment allows exposure to two
distinct sources of endophyte infection. Together, our results show the importance of host
identity and environment in structuring the associated endophyte communities.},

Here we present the assembly and analysis of a genome sequence for the western lowland gorilla, and compare the whole genomes of all extant great ape genera. We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human–chimpanzee and human–chimpanzee–gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30\% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

We report molecular epidemiology of 65 carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates identified from hospitals in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, and California between 2008 and 2009. All isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE}). Select isolates then underwent multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}). While the {PFGE} patterns tended to cluster within each hospital, sequence types ({STs}) belonging to the clonal complex 92 ({CC}92) and the pan-European clonal lineage {II} ({EUII}; worldwide clonal lineage 2) were predominant in all hospitals. Of them, {ST}122 and {ST}208 were the most common and were found in four of the six hospitals. Isolates belonging to the pan-European clonal lineages I and {III} were identified in one hospital each. Carbapenemase-encoding genes {blaOXA}-23 and/or {ISAba}1-{blaOXA}-51-like were present among the majority of isolates. These findings suggest that carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates found in U.S. hospitals constitute part of the global epidemic driven by {CC}92, but have unique {STs} other than {ST}92, which may be spreading by means of patient transfer between health care facilities within the United States.},

Plant pathogenic oomycetes, including Phytophthora, Pythium and downy mildew species, cause devastating diseases on a wide range of host species and have a significant impact on agriculture. Here, we report comparative analyses on the genomes of thirteen straminipilous species, including eleven plant pathogenic oomycetes, to explore common features linked to their pathogenic lifestyle. We report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of six Pythium genomes and comparison with other stramenopiles including photosynthetic diatoms, and other plant pathogenic oomycetes such as Phytophthora species, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and Pythium ultimum var. ultimum. Novel features of the oomycete genomes include an expansion of genes encoding secreted effectors and plant cell wall degrading enzymes in Phytophthora species and an over-representation of genes involved in proteolytic degradation and signal transduction in Pythium species. A complete lack of classical {RxLR} effectors was observed in the seven surveyed Pythium genomes along with an overall reduction of pathogenesis-related gene families in H. arabidopsidis. Comparative analyses revealed fewer genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in Pythium species and H. arabidopsidis as compared to Phytophthora species, suggesting variation in virulence mechanisms within plant pathogenic oomycete species. Shared features between the oomycetes and diatoms revealed common mechanisms of intracellular signaling and transportation. Our analyses demonstrate the value of comparative genome analyses for exploring the evolution of pathogenesis and survival mechanisms in the oomycetes. The comparative analyses of seven Pythium species with the closely related oomycetes, Phytophthora species and H. arabidopsidis, and distantly related diatoms provide insight into genes that underlie virulence.},

However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, {LANDIS}-{II}, and a forest process model, {PnET}-{II}, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, {CO}2, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation ({PAR}). The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000–2400 ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200 ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is {PAR}, the third is {CO}2 and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to {CO}2 enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced.},

A hand-curated {ITS}-{LSU} training set of 1,091 sequences and a larger training set of 8,967 {ITS} region sequences were used. Of the factors evaluated, database composition and quality had the largest effect on classification accuracy, followed by fragment size and use of a bootstrap cutoff to improve classification confidence. The naive Bayesian classifier and {BLASTN} gave similar results at higher taxonomic levels, but the classifier was faster and more accurate at the genus level when a bootstrap cutoff was used. All of the {ITS} and {LSU} sections performed well ({\textgreater}97.7\% accuracy) at higher taxonomic ranks from kingdom to family, and differences between them were small at the genus level (within 0.66 to 1.23\%). When full-length sequence sections were used, the {LSU} outperformed the {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 fragments at the genus level, but the {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 showed higher accuracy when smaller fragment sizes of the same length and a 50\% bootstrap cutoff were used. In a comparison using the larger {ITS} training set, {ITS}1 and {ITS}2 had very similar accuracy classification for fragments between 100 and 200 bp. Collectively, the results show that any of the {ITS} or {LSU} sections we tested provided comparable classification accuracy to the genus level and underscore the need for larger and more diverse classification training sets.},

Unlike Pythium, Phytophthora was essentially monophyletic, all but three species forming a cluster of eight clades. Two clades contained only species with nonpapillate sporangia. The other six clades included either papillate and semipapillate, or semipapillate and nonpapillate types, transcending traditional morphological groupings, which are evidently not natural assemblages. Peronospora was related to P. megakarya and P. palmivora and appears to be derived from a Phytophthora that has both lost the ability to produce zoospores and become an obligate biotroph. Three other Phytophthoras located some distance from the main Phytophthora–Peronospora cluster probably represent one or more additional genera.},

	abstract = {Regions of {rDNA} are commonly used to infer phylogenetic relationships among fungal species and as {DNA} barcodes for identification. These regions occur in large tandem arrays, and concerted evolution is believed to reduce intragenomic variation among copies within these arrays, although some variation still might exist. Phylogenetic studies typically use consensus sequencing, which effectively conceals most intragenomic variation, but cloned sequences containing intragenomic variation are becoming prevalent in {DNA} databases. To understand effects of using cloned {rDNA} sequences in phylogenetic analyses we amplified and cloned the {ITS} region from pure cultures of six Laetiporus species and one Wolfiporia species (Basidiomycota, Polyporales). An average of 66 clones were selected randomly and sequenced from 21 cultures, producing a total of 1399 interpretable sequences. Significant variation (≥ 5\% variation in sequence similarity) was observed among {ITS} copies within six cultures from three species clades (L. cincinnatus, L. sp. clade J, and Wolfiporia dilatohypha) and phylogenetic analyses with the cloned sequences produced different trees relative to analyses with consensus sequences. Cloned sequences from L. cincinnatus fell into more than one species clade and numerous cloned L. cincinnatus sequences fell into entirely new clades, which if analyzed on their own most likely would be recognized as "undescribed" or "novel" taxa. The use of a 95\% cut off for defining operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) produced seven Laetiporus {OTUs} with consensus {ITS} sequences and 20 {OTUs} with cloned {ITS} sequences. The use of cloned {rDNA} sequences might be problematic in fungal phylogenetic analyses, as well as in fungal bar-coding initiatives and efforts to detect fungal pathogens in environmental samples.},

This method employs a {DNA} polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target {DNA}. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target {DNA} initiates {LAMP}. The following strand displacement {DNA} synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded {DNA}. This serves as template for {DNA} synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem–loop {DNA} structure. In subsequent {LAMP} cycling one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement {DNA} synthesis, yielding the original stem–loop {DNA} and a new stem–loop {DNA} with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 109 copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem–loop {DNAs} with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because {LAMP} recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity.},

The recognition that fungi, bacteria, and viruses control key ecosystem functions has made microbial communities a major focus of this field. Because many ecological processes are apparent only at particular spatial or temporal scales, a complete understanding of the linkages between microbial community, environment, and function requires analysis across a wide range of scales. Here, we map the biological and functional geography of soil fungi from local to continental scales and show that the principal ecological processes controlling community structure and function operate at different scales. Similar to plants or animals, most soil fungi are endemic to particular bioregions, suggesting that factors operating at large spatial scales, like dispersal limitation or climate, are the first-order determinants of fungal community structure in nature. By contrast, soil extracellular enzyme activity is highly convergent across bioregions and widely differing fungal communities. Instead, soil enzyme activity is correlated with local soil environment and distribution of fungal traits within the community. The lack of structure–function relationships for soil fungal communities at continental scales indicates a high degree of functional redundancy among fungal communities in global biogeochemical cycles.},

These technologies offer the opportunity to describe microbial communities in depth and to investigate fungal diversity at a large geographical scale. In particular, due to the emergence of studies conducted at a large scale (countries, continents), the definition of a compromise between the optimal and representative description of local diversity (plot scale) and the management of a greater number of sites for these studies is required. This work was performed to explore the local richness and the structure of the ectomycorrhizal ({EcM}) fungal and oomycete communities in a temperate beech plot using 454 pyrosequencing technology. The internal transcribed spacer 1 ({ITS}1) region was amplified and sequenced from fine roots and soil sampled from the two upper horizons. Our analyses suggest that soil could be a good substitute for fine roots in studying {EcM} fungi. The fungal assemblage exhibited a vertical distribution in the soil profile. Only four Pythiaceae were identified, which was insufficient to study the spatial distribution of this group. The fungal and particularly the ectomycorrhizal ({EcM}) richness was not correlated with any soil variable ({pH}, C, N or P), but the spatial structure was explained by the C:N ratio and phosphorus content. Our data reveal the importance of maintaining a minimal representative sampling at the plot scale for comparative geographical studies.},

The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared with placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and {BLAST}. We introduce a slow and accurate as well as a fast and less accurate placement algorithm. For the slow algorithm, we develop additional heuristic techniques that yield almost the same run times as the fast version with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed, the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable with that of a simple {BLAST} search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the {EPA} is significantly higher, in particular when the sample of taxa in the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into {RAxML}, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to {BLAST} for tree-based inference of the evolutionary origin and composition of short sequence reads. We are also actively developing a Web server that offers a freely available service for computing read placements on trees using the {EPA}.},

	abstract = {Endophytes are microorganisms that live within plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. They are important components of plant microbiomes. Endophytes interact with, and overlap in function with, other core microbial groups that colonize plant tissues, e.g., mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens, epiphytes, and saprotrophs. Some fungal endophytes affect plant growth and plant responses to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental change; others produce useful or interesting secondary metabolites. Here, we focus on new techniques and approaches that can provide an integrative understanding of the role of fungal endophytes in the plant microbiome. Clavicipitaceous endophytes of grasses are not considered because they have unique properties distinct from other endophytes. Hidden from view and often overlooked, endophytes are emerging as their diversity, importance for plant growth and survival, and interactions with other organisms are revealed.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} The online community resource Phytophthora database ({PD}) was developed to support accurate and rapid identification of Phytophthora and to help characterize and catalog the diversity and evolutionary relationships within the genus. Since its release in 2008, the sequence database has grown to cover 1 to 12 loci for ≈2,600 isolates (representing 138 described and provisional species). Sequences of multiple mitochondrial loci were added to complement nuclear loci-based phylogenetic analyses and diagnostic tool development. Key characteristics of most newly described and provisional species have been summarized. Other additions to improve the {PD} functionality include: (i) geographic information system tools that enable users to visualize the geographic origins of chosen isolates on a global-scale map, (ii) a tool for comparing genetic similarity between isolates via microsatellite markers to support population genetic studies, (iii) a comprehensive review of molecular diagnostics tools and relevant references, (iv) sequence alignments used to develop polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics tools to support their utilization and new diagnostic tool development, and (v) an online community forum for sharing and preserving experience and knowledge accumulated in the global Phytophthora community. Here we present how these improvements can support users and discuss the {PD}'s future direction.},

	abstract = {{SNPs} discovered by genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 {SNPs} genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all {SNPs} simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped {SNPs}, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the {SNPs} explored to date.

	abstract = {Six {DNA} regions were evaluated as potential {DNA} barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal {RNA} cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, second largest subunit of {RNA} polymerase {II}, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low {PCR} amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the {ITS}. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. {ITS} will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relevés obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the “sampled patch size,” i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species–site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

The D1, D2 and D3 regions of the adjacent large subunit nuclear ribosomal {DNA} of half the Pythium strains were also sequenced and gave a phylogeny congruent with the {ITS} data. All the 40 presently available ex-type strains were included in this study, as well as 20 sequences of recently described species from {GenBank}. Species for which no ex-type strains were available were represented by either authentic strains (6), strains used in the 1981 monograph of the genus by van der Plaats-Niterink (33), or strains selected on morphological criteria (17). Parsimony analysis generated two major clades representing the Pythium species with filamentous or globose sporangia. A small clade of species with contiguous sporangia was found in between the two main clades. A total number of 11 smaller clades was recognized, which often correlated with host-type or substrate and in several cases with a subset of morphological characters. Many characters used in species descriptions, such as antheridium position, did not correlate with phylogeny. A comparison of the ex-type and representative strains with all {ITS} sequences of Pythium in {GenBank} revealed limited infraspecific variation with the exception of P. rostratum, P. irregulare, P. heterothallicum, and P. ultimum. The total number of species examined was 116 (including 60 ex-type strains). Twenty-six species had {ITS} sequences identical or nearly identical to formerly described species, suggesting possible conspecificity.

The occurrence of outbreak is facilitated by both tolerance to desiccation and multidrug resistance, contributing to the maintenance of these organisms in the hospital environment. In addition, the epidemiology of A. baumannii infection is often complex, with the coexistence of epidemic and endemic infections, the latter of which often is favored by the selection pressure of antimicrobials. The only good news is that potentially severe A. baumannii infection, such as bacteremia or pneumonia in patients in the intensive care unit who are undergoing intubation, do not seem to be associated with a higher attributable mortality rate or an increased length of hospital stay.},

	abstract = {Conventional assessments of ecosystem sample composition are based on morphology-based or {DNA} barcode identification of individuals. Both approaches are costly and time-consuming, especially when applied to the large number of specimens and taxa commonly included in ecological investigations. Next-generation sequencing approaches can overcome the bottleneck of individual specimen isolation and identification by simultaneously sequencing specimens of all taxa in a bulk mixture. Here we apply multiple parallel amplification primers, multiple {DNA} barcode markers, 454-pyrosequencing, and Illumina {MiSeq} sequencing to the same sample to maximize recovery of the arthropod macrobiome and the bacterial and other microbial microbiome of a bulk arthropod sample. We validate this method with a complex sample containing 1,066 morphologically distinguishable arthropods from a tropical terrestrial ecosystem with high taxonomic diversity. Multiamplicon next-generation {DNA} barcoding was able to recover sequences corresponding to 91\% of the distinguishable individuals in a bulk environmental sample, as well as many species present as undistinguishable tissue. 454-pyrosequencing was able to recover 10 more families of arthropods and 30 more species than did conventional Sanger sequencing of each individual specimen. The use of other loci (16S and 18S ribosomal {DNA} gene regions) also added the detection of species of microbes associated with these terrestrial arthropods. This method greatly decreases the time and money necessary to perform {DNA}-based comparisons of biodiversity among ecosystem samples. This methodology opens the door to much cheaper and increased capacity for ecological and evolutionary studies applicable to a wide range of socio-economic issues, as well as a basic understanding of how the world works.},

The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared with placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and {BLAST}. We introduce a slow and accurate as well as a fast and less accurate placement algorithm. For the slow algorithm, we develop additional heuristic techniques that yield almost the same run times as the fast version with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed, the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable with that of a simple {BLAST} search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the {EPA} is significantly higher, in particular when the sample of taxa in the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into {RAxML}, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to {BLAST} for tree-based inference of the evolutionary origin and composition of short sequence reads. We are also actively developing a Web server that offers a freely available service for computing read placements on trees using the {EPA}.},

Understanding how high-throughput sequencing is best implemented is important for the interpretation of recent results and the success of future applications. Addressing complex biological questions with metagenomics requires the interaction of researchers who bring different skill sets to problem solving. Educators can help by nurturing a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to genome science, which is essential for effective problem solving. Educators are in a position to help students, teachers, the public and policy makers interpret the new knowledge that metagenomics brings. To do this, they need to understand, not only the excitement of the science but also the pitfalls and shortcomings of methodology and research designs.

Many nucleoporins contain {FG} sequence repeats, and previous studies have demonstrated interactions between repeats containing {FxFG} or {GLFG} cores and transport factors. The crystal structure of residues 1-442 of importin-beta bound to a {GLFG} peptide indicates that this repeat core binds to the same primary site as {FxFG} cores. Importin-beta-I178D shows reduced binding to both {FxFG} and {GLFG} repeats, consistent with both binding to an overlapping site in the hydrophobic groove between the A-helices of {HEAT} repeats 5 and 6. Moreover, {FxFG} repeats can displace importin-beta or its S. cerevisiae homologue, Kap95, bound to {GLFG} repeats. Addition of soluble {GLFG} repeats decreases the rate of nuclear protein import in digitonin-permeabilized {HeLa} cells, indicating that this interaction has a role in the translocation of carrier-cargo complexes through nuclear pores. The binding of {GLFG} and {FxFG} repeats to overlapping sites on importin-beta indicates that functional differences between different repeats probably arise from differences in their spatial organization.},

We investigated fungal communities in decaying Norway spruce logs at various spatial scales at two environmentally different locations in Sweden. On the basis of 454 pyrosequencing of the {ITS}2 region of {rDNA}, 1914 operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) were detected in 353 samples. The communities differed significantly among logs, but the physical distance between logs was not found to have a significant effect on whether fungal communities had any resemblance to each other. Within a log, samples that were closer together generally had communities that showed more resemblance to each other than those that were further apart. {OTUs} characteristic for particular positions on the logs could be identified. In general, these {OTUs} did not overlap with the most abundant {OTUs}, and their ecological role was often unknown. Only a few {OTUs} were detected in the majority of logs, whereas numerous {OTUs} were rare and present in only one or a few logs. Wood-decaying Basidiomycetes were often represented by higher sequence reads in individual logs than Ascomycete {OTUs}, suggesting that Basidiomycete mycelia spread out more rapidly when established. {OTU} richness tended to increase with the decay stage of the sample; however, the known wood decayers were most abundant in less-decomposed samples. The fungi identified in the logs represented different ecological strategies. Our findings differ from previously published sporocarp studies, indicating that the highly abundant fruiting species may respond to environment in different ways than the rest of the fungal community.},

	abstract = {The outcome of competitive interactions is likely to be influenced by both competitive dominance (i.e. niche-based dynamics) and ecological drift (i.e. neutral dynamics governed by demographic stochasticity). However, spatial models of competition rarely consider the joint operation of these two processes. We develop a model based on the original competition-colonization trade-off model that incorporates niche and neutral processes and several realistic facets of ecological dynamics: it allows local competition (i.e. competition within a patch) to occur within communities of a finite size, it allows competitors to vary in the degree of competitive asymmetry, and it includes the role of local migration (i.e. propagule pressure). The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e.g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt.},

The organism causes outbreaks of infection and health care–associated infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, and wound infection. Antimicrobial resistance greatly limits the therapeutic options for patients who are infected with this organism, especially if isolates are resistant to the carbapenem class of antimicrobial agents. Because therapeutic options are limited for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection, the development or discovery of new therapies, well-controlled clinical trials of existing antimicrobial regimens and combinations, and greater emphasis on the prevention of health care–associated transmission of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection are essential.},

This appears to coordinate photosynthesis-related gene expression and to influence the nuclear expression of a specific cold-acclimation gene, plant morphology and differentiation in cyanobacteria. Thus, in addition to its traditional role in energy transduction, the photosynthetic apparatus might also be an environmental sensor.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperatures and solar ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation have been implicated as recent causes for the loss of symbiotic algae (i.e., bleaching) in corals and other invertebrates with photoautotrophic symbionts. One hypothesized mechanism of coral bleaching involves the production of reduced oxygen intermediates, or toxic oxygen, in the dinoflagellate symbionts and host tissues that subsequently causes cellular damage and expulsion of symbionts. Measurements of photosynthesis in the Caribbean coral Agaricia tenuifolia, taken during temperature-induced stress and exposure to full solar radiation, showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance followed by bleaching. Exposure of corals to exogenous antioxidants that scavenge reactive oxygen species during temperature-induced stress improves maximum photosynthetic capacity to rates indistinguishable from corals measured at the ambient temperature of their site of collection. Additionally, these antioxidants prevent the coral from “ bleaching ” and affect the mechanism of symbiont loss from the coral host. These observations confirm a role for oxidative stress, whether caused by elevated temperatures or exposure to {UV} radiation, in the bleaching phenomenon.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the {ANUSPLIN} package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	abstract = {Genotyping methods are essential to understand the transmission dynamics of Acinetobacter baumannii. We examined the representative genotypes of A. baumannii at different time periods in select locations in Ohio, using two rapid automated typing methods: {PCR} coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ({PCR}/{ESI}-{MS}), a form of multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}), and repetitive-sequence-based-{PCR} (rep-{PCR}). Our analysis included 122 isolates from 4 referral hospital systems, in 2 urban areas of Ohio. These isolates were associated with outbreaks at 3 different time periods (1996, 2000 and 2005–2007). Type assignments of {PCR}/{ESI}-{MS} and rep-{PCR} were compared to each other and to worldwide ({WW}) clone types. The discriminatory power of each method was determined using the Simpson's index of diversity ({DI}). We observed that {PCR}/{ESI}-{MS} sequence type ({ST}) 14, corresponding to {WW} clone 3, predominated in 1996, whereas {ST} 12 and 14 co-existed in the intermediate period (2000) and {ST} 10 and 12, belonging to {WW} clone 2, predominated more recently in 2007. The shift from {WW} clone 3 to {WW} clone 2 was accompanied by an increase in carbapenem resistance. The {DI} was approximately 0.74 for {PCR}/{ESI}-{MS}, 0.88 for rep-{PCR} and 0.90 for the combination of both typing methods. We conclude that combining rapid automated typing methods such as {PCR}/{ESI}-{MS} and rep-{PCR} serves to optimally characterize the regional molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii. Our data also sheds light on the changing sequence types in an 11 year period in Northeast Ohio.},

Sudden oak death, caused by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, has caused devastating levels of mortality of live oak and tanoak trees in coastal California forests and in urban and suburban landscapes in the San Francisco Bay Area. This pathogen also causes non-lethal disease on popular ornamental plants, including rhododendrons, viburnums, and camellias. P. ramorum was discovered in California in the late 1990s and is exotic to the United States. Recently, presence of the disease in wholesale nurseries in California, Oregon, and Washington has led to shipments of diseased plants across the {US}, thus risking the introduction of the pathogen to other vulnerable forests. We examined the genetic diversity of this pathogen in {US} nurseries in order to better understand its evolution in nurseries and movement between states. We found that California populations were genetically different enough from Oregon and Washington populations that infestations of the pathogen found in nurseries in other states could be distinguished as having originated from California or the Northwest. Our inferences were consistent with trace forward investigations by regulatory agencies.},

B-{ARISA} profiles revealed a significant difference in the endophytic community between cultivars ({perMANOVA}, p {\textless} 0.001), and canonical correspondence analysis showed a significant correlation between the community structure and plant biomass (p = 0.001). Pyrosequencing detected, on average, 477 ± 71 bacterial operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}, 97\% genetic similarity) residing within the roots of each cultivar, with a Chao estimated total {OTU} richness of 1,265 ± 313. Across all cultivars, a total of 238 known genera from 15 phyla were identified. Interestingly, five of the ten most common genera (Rheinheimera, Dyadobacter, Devosia, Pedobacter, and Pseudoxanthomonas) have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported as endophytes of potato. Like the B-{ARISA} analysis, the endophytic communities differed between cultivar/clones (∫-libshuff, p {\textless} 0.001) and exhibited low similarities on both a presence/absence (0.145 ± 0.019) and abundance (0.420 ± 0.081) basis. Seventeen {OTUs} showed a strong positive (r {\textgreater} 0.600) or negative (r {\textless} −0.600) correlation with plant biomass, suggesting a possible link between plant production and endophyte abundance. This study represents one of the most comprehensive assessments of the bacterial endophytic communities to date, and similar analyses in other plant species, cultivars, or tissues could be utilized to further elucidate the potential contribution(s) of endophytic communities to plant physiology and production.},

The protocols combine mass trapping of arthropods, mass-{PCR} amplification of the {COI} barcode gene, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis, which together we call ‘metabarcoding’. 3. We construct seven communities of arthropods (mostly insects) and show that it is possible to recover a substantial proportion of the original taxonomic information. We further demonstrate, for the first time, that metabarcoding allows for the precise estimation of pairwise community dissimilarity (beta diversity) and within-community phylogenetic diversity (alpha diversity), despite the inevitable loss of taxonomic information inherent to metabarcoding. 4. Alpha and beta diversity metrics are the raw materials of ecology and the environmental sciences, facilitating assessment of the state of the environment with a broad and efficient measure of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of multidrug resistance ({MDR}) in Acinetobacter baumannii has raised concern in health care settings worldwide. In order to understand the repertoire of resistance determinants and their organization and origins, we compared the genome sequences of three {MDR} and three drug-susceptible A. baumannii isolates. The entire {MDR} phenotype can be explained by the acquisition of discrete resistance determinants distributed throughout the genome. A comparison of closely related {MDR} and drug-susceptible isolates suggests that drug efflux may be a less significant contributor to resistance to certain classes of antibiotics than inactivation enzymes are. A resistance island with a variable composition of resistance determinants interspersed with transposons, integrons, and other mobile genetic elements is a significant but not universal contributor to the {MDR} phenotype. Four hundred seventy-five genes are shared among all six clinical isolates but absent from the related environmental species Acinetobacter baylyi {ADP}1. These genes are enriched for transcription factors and transporters and suggest physiological features of A. baumannii that are related to adaptation for growth in association with humans.},

	abstract = {Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant pathogens that likely infect and disrupt all cellular organisms. Although a high diversity of viral types has been characterized from corals over the last decade, we are only beginning to understand the distribution, dynamics, and roles of viral consortia in reef ecosystems. This review synthesizes previous work on the viruses associated with corals and their cnidarian relatives, and highlights some strengths and limitations of the methods commonly used for viral analysis. Based on these foundational studies, we present a current working model for stony coral virology. We hypothesize that viruses are present on and within corals and that these consortia commonly include representatives of the Herpesviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and phages and archaeal viruses. Our working model posits that these different viral groups target distinct hosts, specifically the coral itself, its endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.), and its resident microbiome, respectively. Corals may also harbor additional viral diversity (e.g., members of the Iridoviridae) that is pathogenic to reef-associated organisms. Viral infections likely underlie some coral diseases and may be responsible for reef epizootics, but evidence for viral-mediated coral disease is currently inconclusive. Future efforts in coral viral ecology should focus on determining if and how viral infection contributes to reduced coral fitness and/or benthic community shifts in reef ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Glacial Lake Missoula formed when the Purcell Trench lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet dammed Clark Fork River in Montana during the Fraser Glaciation (marine oxygen isotope stage 2). Over a period of several thousand years, the lake repeatedly filled and drained through its ice dam, and floodwaters coursed across the landscape in eastern Washington. In this paper, we describe the stratigraphy and sedimentology of a significant new section of fine-grained glacial Lake Missoula sediment and compare this section to a similar, previously described sequence of sediments at Ninemile Creek, 26 km to the northwest. The new exposure, which we informally term the rail line section, is located near Missoula, Montana, and exposes 29 units, each of which consists of many silt and clay couplets that we interpret to be varves. The deposits are similar to other fine-grained sediments attributed to glacial Lake Missoula. Similar varved sediments overlie gravelly flood deposits elsewhere in the glacial Lake Missoula basin. Each of the 29 units represents a period when the lake was deepening, and all units show evidence for substantial draining of glacial Lake Missoula that repeatedly exposed the lake floor. The evidence includes erosion and deformation of glaciolacustrine sediment that we interpret happened during draining of the lake, desiccation cracks that formed during exposure of the lake bottom, and fluvial sand deposited as the lake began to refill.

The floods date to between approximately 21.4 and 13.4 cal ka ago based on regional chronological data. The total number of varves at the rail line and Ninemile sites are, respectively, 732 and 583. Depending on lake refilling times, each exposure probably records 1350–1500 years of time. We present three new optical ages from the rail line and Ninemile sites that further limit the age of the floods. These ages, in calendar years, are 15.1 ± 0.6 ka at the base of the Ninemile exposure, and 14.8 ± 0.7 and 12.6 ± 0.6 ka midway through the rail line exposure. The sediment at the two sections was deposited during later stages of glacial Lake Missoula, after the largest outburst events.},

	abstract = {Changes in the distribution of sub-alpine tree species in western North America have been attributed to climatic change and other environmental stresses. These changes include tree-line fluctuations throughout the Holocene and recent invasion of sub-alpine meadows by forest. Most palaeoecological studies suggest that the tree-line was higher during a period of warmer climate approximately 9000 to 5000 {BP} and lower during the last 5000 years, with short periods of local tree-line advance. Recent advances in sub-alpine tree distribution can be compared with weather records, allowing an examination of relationships between tree advance and climate at a finer resolution. In general, recent sub-alpine forest advances in western North America, based on studies representing three climatic zones (maritime, Mediterranean and continental), have been associated with climatic periods favouring tree germination and growth, although factors such as fire and grazing by domestic livestock have had an impact in some areas. Limitations to tree establishment (e.g., winter snow accumulation, summer drought) vary in relative importance within each climate zone, as do predicted consequences of anthropogenic climatic change. Recent increases in establishment of sub-alpine trees may continue if climatic change alleviates the limitations to tree establishment important in each climatic zone. However, factors such as topography and disturbance may modify tree establishment on a local scale.},

Integration of shotgun sequence assembly with genetic mapping enabled chromosome-scale reconstruction of the genome. More than 45,000 putative protein-coding genes were identified. Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second, older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution, tandem gene duplication, and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis, ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene. However, the relative frequency of protein domains in the two genomes is similar. Overrepresented exceptions in Populus include genes associated with lignocellulosic wall biosynthesis, meristem development, disease resistance, and metabolite transport.},

The two vectors, {YEp}351 and {YEp}352, have the following properties: (1) they can replicate autonomuosly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in E. coli; (2) they contain the β-lactamase gene and confer ampicillin resistance to E. coli; (3) they contain the entire sequence of {pUC}18; (4) all ten restriction sites of the multiple cloning region of {pUC}18 including {EcoRI}, {SacI}, {KpnI}, {SmaI}, {BamH}1, {XbaI}, {SbaI}, {SalI}, {PstI}, {SphI} and {HindIII} are unique in {YEp}352; these sites are also unique in {YEp}351 except for {EcoRI} and {KpnI}, which occur twice; (5) recombinant plasmids with {DNA} inserts in the multiple cloning region of {YEp}351 and {YEp}352 can be recognised by loss of β-galactosidase function in appropriate E. coli hosts; (6) {YEp}351 and {YEp}352 contain the yeast {LEU}2 and {URA}3 genes, respectively, allowing for selection of these grown under non-selective conditions indicative of high plasmid copy number. The above properties make the shuttle vectors suitable for constructions of yeast genomic libraries and for cloning of {DNA} fragments defined by a large number of different restriction sites.The two vectors have been further modified by deletion of the sequences necessary for antunomous replication in yeast. The derivative plasmids {YIp}651 and {YIp}352 can therefore be used ti integrate specific sequences into yeast chromosomal {DNA}.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian coalescent-based method has recently been proposed to delimit species using multilocus genetic sequence data. Posterior probabilities of different species delimitation models are calculated using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The method accounts for species phylogenies and coalescent events in both extant and extinct species and accommodates lineage sorting and uncertainties in the gene trees. Although the method is theoretically appealing, its utility in practical data analysis is yet to be rigorously examined. In particular, the analysis may be sensitive to priors on ancestral population sizes and on species divergence times and to gene flow between species. Here we conduct a computer simulation to evaluate the statistical performance of the method, such as the false negatives (the error of lumping multiple species into one) and false positives (the error of splitting one species into several). We found that the correct species model was inferred with high posterior probability with only one or two loci when 5 or 10 sequences were sampled from each population, or with 50 loci when only one sequence was sampled. We also simulated data allowing migration under a two-species model, a mainland-island model and a stepping-stone model to assess the impact of gene flow (hybridization or introgression). The behavior of the method was diametrically different depending on the migration rate. Low rates at {\textless} 0.1 migrants per generation had virtually no effect, so that the method, while assuming no hybridization between species, identified distinct species despite small amounts of gene flow. This behavior appears to be consistent with biologists' practice. In contrast, higher migration rates at ≥ 10 migrants per generation caused the method to infer one species. At intermediate levels of migration, the method is indecisive. Our results suggest that Bayesian analysis under the multispecies coalescent model may provide important insights into population divergences, and may be useful for generating hypotheses of species delimitation, to be assessed with independent information from anatomical, behavioral, and ecological data.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, culture-independent surveys of marine picoeukaryotic diversity based on 18S ribosomal {DNA} clone libraries have unveiled numerous sequences of novel high-rank taxa. This newfound diversity has significantly altered our understanding of marine microbial food webs and the evolution of eukaryotes. However, the current picture of marine eukaryotic biodiversity may be significantly skewed by {PCR} amplification biases, occurrence of {rDNA} genes in multiple copies within a single cell, and the capacity of {DNA} to persist as extracellular material. In this study we performed an analysis of the metagenomic dataset from the Global Ocean Survey ({GOS}) expedition, seeking eukaryotic ribosomal signatures. This {PCR}-free approach revealed similar phylogenetic patterns to clone library surveys, suggesting that {PCR} steps do not impose major biases in the exploration of environmental {DNA}. The different cell size fractions within the {GOS} dataset, however, displayed a distinct picture. High protistan diversity in the {\textless}0.8 µm size fraction, in particular sequences from radiolarians and ciliates (and their absence in the 0.8–3 µm fraction), suggest that most of the {DNA} in this fraction comes from extracellular material from larger cells. In addition, we compared the phylogenetic patterns from {rDNA} and reverse transcribed {rRNA} 18S clone libraries from the same sample harvested in the Mediterranean Sea. The libraries revealed major differences, with taxa such as pelagophytes or picobiliphytes only detected in the 18S {rRNA} library. {MAST} (Marine Stramenopiles) appeared as potentially prominent grazers and we observed a significant decrease in the contribution of alveolate and radiolarian sequences, which overwhelmingly dominated {rDNA} libraries. The {rRNA} approach appears to be less affected by taxon-specific {rDNA} copy number and likely better depicts the biogeochemical significance of marine protists.},

Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the {GTR}+{CAT} approximation as replacement for {GTR}+Γ yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of {RAxML}. A large-scale performance comparison with {GARLI}, {PHYML}, {IQPNNI} and {MrBayes} on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that {RAxML} requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program ({GARLI}) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets ≥4000 taxa it also runs 2–3 times faster than {GARLI}. {RAxML} has been parallelized with {MPI} to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute {ML} trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25 057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively.

	abstract = {The coral holobiont is a dynamic assemblage of the coral animal, zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, Bacteria,Archaea and viruses. Zooxanthellae and some Bacteria form relatively stable and species-specific associations with corals. Other associations are less specific; coral-associated Archaea differ from those in the water column, but the same archaeal species may be found on different coral species. It has been hypothesized that the coral animal can adapt to differing ecological niches by ‘switching’ its microbial associates. In the case of corals and zooxanthellae, this has been termed adaptive bleaching and it has important implications for carbon cycling within the coral holobiont and ultimately the survival of coral reefs. However, the roles of other components of the coral holobiont are essentially unknown. To better understand these other coral associates, a fractionation procedure was used to separate the microbes, mitochondria and viruses from the coral animal cells and zooxanthellae. The resulting metagenomic {DNA} was sequenced using pyrosequencing. Fungi, Bacteria and phage were the most commonly identified organisms in the metagenome. Three of the four fungal phyla were represented, including a wide diversity of fungal genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that the endolithic community is more important than previously appreciated. In particular, the data suggested that endolithic fungi could be converting nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, which would enable fixed nitrogen to cycle within the coral holobiont. The most prominent bacterial groups were Proteobacteria (68\%), Firmicutes (10\%), Cyanobacteria (7\%) and Actinobacteria (6\%). Functionally, the bacterial community was primarily heterotrophic and included a number of pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds, the most abundant being the homogentisate pathway. The most abundant phage family was the {ssDNA} Microphage and most of the eukaryotic viruses were most closely related to those known to infect aquatic organisms. This study provides a metabolic and taxonomic snapshot of microbes associated with the reef-building coral Porites astreoides and presents a basis for understanding how coral–microbial interactions structure the holobiont and coral reefs.},

We have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. Our results showed that {ITS}4-B, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer {ITS}1 or the fungal-specific primer {ITS}1-F, efficiently amplified {DNA} from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete {DNAs}. The results with plants were not as clearcut. The {ITS}1-F/{ITS}4-B primer pair produced a small amount of {PCR} product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ {ITS} primers. However, under conditions where both plant and fungal {DNAs} were present, the fungal {DNA} was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant {DNA}. {ITS}1-F/{ITS}4-B preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust-infected tissues.

However, there are rising concerns about the ability of aspen to persist in portions of its range, based on bioclimatic modeling, physiological thresholds and mortality surveys. Our ability to predict and mitigate aspen decline will depend on our understanding of the factors influencing aspen establishment and persistence. Genetic techniques are providing important insights about reproductive strategies, evolutionary and demographic histories, and adaptive capacity in western aspen, often with important and novel management implications. A suite of new genetic tools is also becoming available as a result of innovations in genomic sequencing technology, along with the availability of an annotated reference genome for Populus species. Here we present a synthesis of how these genetic tools have been, and could be, used to answer questions directly relevant to aspen ecology and management. We also present a brief description of the molecular tools themselves. Our goal is to provide an informational resource to forest managers about the utility of traditional and emerging genetic technologies, with specific relevance to aspen ecology and management.},

To address this critical gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data ({\textgreater} 1300 datapoints) to compare belowground plant, microbial and faunal biomass across seven of the major biomes on Earth. We also assembled data to assess biome-level patterns in belowground microbial community composition. Our analysis suggests that variation in microbial biomass is predictable across biomes, with microbial biomass carbon representing 0.6–1.1\% of soil organic carbon (r2 = 0.91) and 1–20\% of total plant biomass carbon (r2 = 0.42). Approximately 50\% of total animal biomass can be found belowground and soil faunal biomass represents {\textless} 4\% of microbial biomass across all biomes. The structure of belowground microbial communities is also predictable: bacterial community composition and fungal : bacterial gene ratios can be predicted reasonably well from soil {pH} and soil C : N ratios respectively. Together these results identify robust patterns in the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities at broad scales which may be explained by universal mechanisms that regulate belowground biota across biomes.},

	abstract = {Causes of late Quaternary extinctions of large mammals (“megafauna”) continue to be debated, especially for continental losses, because spatial and temporal patterns of extinction are poorly known. Accurate latest appearance dates ({LADs}) for such taxa are critical for interpreting the process of extinction. The extinction of woolly mammoth and horse in northwestern North America is currently placed at 15,000–13,000 calendar years before present (yr {BP}), based on {LADs} from dating surveys of macrofossils (bones and teeth). Advantages of using macrofossils to estimate when a species became extinct are offset, however, by the improbability of finding and dating the remains of the last-surviving members of populations that were restricted in numbers or confined to refugia. Here we report an alternative approach to detect ‘ghost ranges' of dwindling populations, based on recovery of ancient {DNA} from perennially frozen and securely dated sediments ({sedaDNA}). In such contexts, {sedaDNA} can reveal the molecular presence of species that appear absent in the macrofossil record. We show that woolly mammoth and horse persisted in interior Alaska until at least 10,500 yr {BP}, several thousands of years later than indicated from macrofossil surveys. These results contradict claims that Holocene survival of mammoths in Beringia was restricted to ecologically isolated high-latitude islands. More importantly, our finding that mammoth and horse overlapped with humans for several millennia in the region where people initially entered the Americas challenges theories that megafaunal extinction occurred within centuries of human arrival or were due to an extraterrestrial impact in the late Pleistocene.},

While for 16S {rDNA}, relevant regions have been well described, no truly systematic design of 18S {rDNA} primers aimed at resolving eukaryotic diversity has yet been reported. Here we used 31,862 18S {rDNA} sequences to design a set of broad-taxonomic range degenerate {PCR} primers. We simulated the phylogenetic information that each candidate primer pair would retrieve using paired- or single-end reads of various lengths, representing different sequencing technologies. Primer pairs targeting the V4 region performed best, allowing discrimination with paired-end reads as short as 150 bp (with 75\% accuracy at genus level). The conditions for {PCR} amplification were optimised for one of these primer pairs and this was used to amplify 18S {rDNA} sequences from isolates as well as from a range of environmental samples which were then Illumina sequenced and analysed, revealing good concordance between expected and observed results. In summary, the reported primer sets will allow minimally biased assessment of eukaryotic diversity in different microbial ecosystems.},

We sought to better understand its behavior through studying the molecular epidemiology of this organism at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, over a 10-year period. Multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}), semiautomated repetitive sequence-based {PCR} (rep-{PCR}), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE}) were performed on a selection of 31 A. baumannii isolates collected over the 10-year period to determine their relationships to one another. {MLST} also allowed us to put this information in a global context. The presence or absence of {blaOXA}-23 was also established. The presence of {blaOXA}-23 closely correlated with carbapenem resistance in our collection. Sequence type 92 ({ST}92) was the dominant sequence type and was present in the hospital for 9 years. There was also evidence of the spread of {ST}69, {ST}73, and {ST}125 (novel) within the hospital, but this was not sustained over long periods. There were only single examples of the novel sequence types {ST}126 and {ST}127. The different typing methods clustered the isolates similarly; however, {PFGE} and rep-{PCR} were more discriminatory than {MLST}. Worldwide, {ST}92 and the associated clonal complex 92 represent the most sampled and widespread sequence type(s) and are also known as European clone 2 and worldwide clonal lineage 2. Antibiotic susceptibility within {ST}92 is variable, suggesting a role for mechanisms other than antibiotic resistance in its success.},

Thirty root systems were collected from three fields, half of which showing clear symptoms of root rot. In total, 500 461 internal transcribed spacer-1 sequences were obtained that were clustered into 123 (roots), 271 (rhizosphere), and 440 (bulk soil) nonsingleton operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}). Species richness was highest in bulk soils and lowest in roots; however, no notable differences in richness were observed between samples associated with diseased and healthy roots. Health status and field both had significant effects on fungal community structures in roots, whereas only field had significant effects on communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils. Indicator species analysis across the three fields identified a number of {OTUs} that were more abundant in healthy roots. Pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum were abundant in diseased roots in some fields. Patterns of disease and causal agents of root rot were different among the three fields, which were also reflected in fungal communities. In conclusion, health status of roots was only vaguely reflected in rhizosphere and bulk soil fungal communities, whereas health status was more important for shaping root communities.},

Since 2008, numerous high-impact microbial metagenomic sequencing studies, which have relied on both classical and next-generation sequencing, have been published. As a result, many previously unrecognized taxa and biota have been identified, but none of these studies explored eukaryote diversity.

Here, we compare these two methods for the identification of a limited number of Noctuoidea moth species. Based on the commonly used mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (the standard {DNA} barcode for animal species), 14 probes were designed and synthesized for 14 species shared by two national nature reserves in Beijing and Hebei, China. Probes ranged in length from 18 to 27 bp and were designed as mismatch probes to guarantee that there were at least three base differences between the probe and nontarget sequences. The results on the chip could be detected by the naked eye without needing special equipment. No cross-hybridizations were detected although we tested all probes on the 14 target and 24 nontarget Noctuoidea species. The neighbour-joining tree of the 38 species based on {COI} sequences gave 38 highly supported independent groups. Both {DNA} barcoding and thin-film biosensor chips, based on the {COI} gene, are able to accurately identify and discriminate the 14 targeted moth species in this study. Because of its speed, high accuracy and low cost, the thin-film biosensor chip is a very practical means of species identification. Now, a more comprehensive chip will be developed for the identification of additional Noctuoidea moths for pest control and ecological protection.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-13-134},
	abstract = {Background
Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as {BLAST} to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the {BLAST} program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as {BLAST} is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.

Results
We present a new software tool called Primer-{BLAST} to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines {BLAST} with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to primers. Primer-{BLAST} allows users to design new target-specific primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-{BLAST} also supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) sites in primers.

Conclusions
We describe a robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs target-specific {PCR} primers. Primer-{BLAST} offers flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other primer properties. This tool is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast.},

	abstract = {This review is directed at understanding how neuronal death occurs in two distinct insults, global ischemia and focal ischemia. These are the two principal rodent models for human disease. Cell death occurs by a necrotic pathway characterized by either ischemic/homogenizing cell change or edematous cell change. Death also occurs via an apoptotic-like pathway that is characterized, minimally, by {DNA} laddering and a dependence on caspase activity and, optimally, by those properties, additional characteristic protein and phospholipid changes, and morphological attributes of apotosis. Death may also occur by autophagocytosis. The cell death process has four major stages. The first, the induction stage, includes several changes initiated by ischemia and reperfusion that are very likely to play major roles in cell death. These include inhibition (and subsequent reactivation) of electron transport, decreased {ATP}, decreased {pH}, increased cell Ca2+, release of glutamate, increased arachidonic acid, and also gene activation leading to cytokine synthesis, synthesis of enzymes involved in free radical production, and accumulation of leukocytes. These changes lead to the activation of five damaging events, termed perpetrators. These are the damaging actions of free radicals and their product peroxynitrite, the actions of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain, the activity of phospholipases, the activity of poly-{ADPribose} polymerase ({PARP}), and the activation of the apoptotic pathway. The second stage of cell death involves the long-term changes in macromolecules or key metabolites that are caused by the perpetrators. The third stage of cell death involves long-term damaging effects of these macromolecular and metabolite changes, and of some of the induction processes, on critical cell functions and structures that lead to the defined end stages of cell damage. These targeted functions and structures include the plasmalemma, the mitochondria, the cytoskeleton, protein synthesis, and kinase activities. The fourth stage is the progression to the morphological and biochemical end stages of cell death. Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca2+-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite. Effects of a large number of damaging changes can be explained on the basis of their ability to generate free radicals in early or late stages of damage. Several important issues are defined for future study. These include determining the triggers for apoptosis and autophagocytosis and establishing greater confidence in most of the cellular changes that are hypothesized to be involved in cell death. A very important outstanding issue is identifying the critical functional and structural changes caused by the perpetrators of cell death. These changes are responsible for cell death, and their identity and mechanisms of action are almost completely unknown.},

However, whilst range expansions at high elevations and latitudes have been widely documented, there has been surprisingly little evidence for contractions at warm margins. We show that lower elevational limits for 16 butterfly species in central Spain have risen on average by 212 m (± {SE} 60) in 30 years, accompanying a 1.3 °C rise (equivalent to c. 225 m) in mean annual temperature. These elevational shifts signify an average reduction in habitable area by one-third, with losses of 50–80\% projected for the coming century, given maintenance of the species thermal associations. The results suggest that many species have already suffered climate-mediated habitat losses that may threaten their long-term chances of survival.},

Nutt.) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, U.S.A.). Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate–growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.Les auteurs ont étudié la variation régionale des facteurs qui limitent la croissance et les réponses à la variabilité climatique de forêts subalpines en analysant les patrons de croissance de 28 séries dendrochronologiques établies à partir de peuplements de sapin subalpin (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) situés dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic (Washington et Oregon, États-Unis). Une analyse factorielle a identifié quatre séries temporelles distinctes de patrons de croissance communs; le patron de croissance dominant dans tous les sites varie en fonction de la précipitation annuelle et de la température (altitude). Dans la plus grande partie de la région, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la précipitation hivernale et à la hauteur de neige accumulée au printemps, ce qui indique que la croissance est surtout limitée par de courtes saisons de croissance. Dans les sites les plus chauds et les plus secs, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la température de l'été précédent, indiquant qu'une faible quantité d'humidité dans le sol en été limite la croissance. Les patrons de croissance de deux régions sont sensibles aux variations climatiques associées à l'Oscillation Décennale du Pacifique, en répondant apparemment à la variation de basse fréquence de la couverture nivale au printemps et de l'humidité du sol en été (négativement dans un cas et positivement dans l'autre). Cette analyse à l'échelle régionale montre que la croissance du sapin subalpin dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic est limitée par des facteurs climatiques différents dans des climats sous-régionaux différents. Les relations entre la croissance et le climat sont similaires à celles d'une espèce cooccurrente, la pruche des montagnes (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.)

	abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. This microorganism survives in hospital environments despite unfavorable conditions such as desiccation, nutrient starvation and antimicrobial treatments. It is hypothesized that its ability to persist in these environments, as well as its virulence, is a result of its capacity to form biofilms. A. baumannii forms biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as polystyrene and glass as well as biotic surfaces such as epithelial cells and fungal filaments. Pili assembly and production of the Bap surface-adhesion protein play a role in biofilm initiation and maturation after initial attachment to abiotic surfaces. Furthermore, the adhesion and biofilm phenotypes of some clinical isolates seem to be related to the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. The regulation of the formation and development of these biofilms is as diverse as the surfaces on which this bacterium persists and as the cellular components that participate in this programmed multistep process. The regulatory processes associated with biofilm formation include sensing of bacterial cell density, the presence of different nutrients and the concentration of free cations available to bacterial cells. Some of these extracellular signals may be sensed by two-component regulatory systems such as {BfmRS}. This transcriptional regulatory system activates the expression of the usher-chaperone assembly system responsible for the production of pili, needed for cell attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. However, such a system is not required for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces when cells are cultured in chemically defined media. Interestingly, the {BfmRS} system also controls cell morphology under particular culture conditions.},

Here, we use a candidate gene-based approach to search for genetic associations between 384 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) markers from 117 candidate genes and 21 cold-hardiness related traits. A general linear model approach, including population structure estimates as covariates, was implemented for each marker–trait pair. We discovered 30 highly significant genetic associations [false discovery rate ({FDR}) Q {\textless} 0.10] across 12 candidate genes and 10 of the 21 traits. We also detected a set of 7 markers that had elevated levels of differentiation between sampling sites situated across the Cascade crest in northeastern Washington. Marker effects were small (r2 {\textless} 0.05) and within the range of those published previously for forest trees. The derived {SNP} allele, as measured by a comparison to a recently diverged sister species, typically affected the phenotype in a way consistent with cold hardiness. The majority of markers were characterized as having largely nonadditive modes of gene action, especially underdominance in the case of cold-tolerance related phenotypes. We place these results in the context of trade-offs between the abilities to grow longer and to avoid fall cold damage, as well as putative epigenetic effects. These associations provide insight into the genetic components of complex traits in coastal Douglas fir, as well as highlight the need for landscape genetic approaches to the detection of adaptive genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.},

Carrière), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.Les auteurs ont étudié la variation régionale des facteurs qui limitent la croissance et les réponses à la variabilité climatique de forêts subalpines en analysant les patrons de croissance de 28 séries dendrochronologiques établies à partir de peuplements de sapin subalpin (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) situés dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic (Washington et Oregon, États-Unis). Une analyse factorielle a identifié quatre séries temporelles distinctes de patrons de croissance communs; le patron de croissance dominant dans tous les sites varie en fonction de la précipitation annuelle et de la température (altitude). Dans la plus grande partie de la région, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la précipitation hivernale et à la hauteur de neige accumulée au printemps, ce qui indique que la croissance est surtout limitée par de courtes saisons de croissance. Dans les sites les plus chauds et les plus secs, la croissance est négativement corrélée à la température de l'été précédent, indiquant qu'une faible quantité d'humidité dans le sol en été limite la croissance. Les patrons de croissance de deux régions sont sensibles aux variations climatiques associées à l'Oscillation Décennale du Pacifique, en répondant apparemment à la variation de basse fréquence de la couverture nivale au printemps et de l'humidité du sol en été (négativement dans un cas et positivement dans l'autre). Cette analyse à l'échelle régionale montre que la croissance du sapin subalpin dans les Cascades et les monts Olympic est limitée par des facteurs climatiques différents dans des climats sous-régionaux différents. Les relations entre la croissance et le climat sont similaires à celles d'une espèce cooccurrente, la pruche des montagnes (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière), ce qui suggère l'existence de larges patrons biogéographiques de réponse à la variabilité et au changement climatique dans les écosystèmes forestiers subalpins du Nord-Ouest du Pacifique.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

In this study, we assess the small-scale reproducibility of taxonomic composition obtained from sequencing four molecular markers (mitochondrial 12S ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}), prokaryote 16S {rDNA}, mitochondrial cox1 and chloroplast {trnL} intron) from two soil cores sampled 10 cm apart. In addition, sequenced control reactions were used to produce a contaminant library that was used to filter similar sequences from sample libraries. Contaminant filtering resulted in the removal of 1\% of reads or 0.3\% of operational taxonomic units. We found similar richness, overlap, abundance and taxonomic diversity from the 12S, 16S and {trnL} markers from each soil core. Jaccard dissimilarity across the two soil cores was highest for metazoan taxa detected by the 12S and cox1 markers. Taxonomic community distances were similar for each marker across the two soil cores when the chi-squared metric was used; however, the 12S and cox1 markers did not cluster well when the Goodall similarity metric was used. A comparison of plant macrofossil vs. read abundance corroborates previous work that suggests eastern Beringia was dominated by grasses and forbs during cold stages of the Pleistocene, a habitat that is restricted to isolated sites in the present-day Yukon.},

	abstract = {Coral bleaching, i.e., loss of most of the symbiotic zooxanthellae normally found within coral tissue, has occurred with increasing frequency on coral reefs throughout the world in the last 20 years, mostly during periods of El Nino Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}). Experiments and observations indicate that coral bleaching results primarily from elevated seawater temperatures under high light conditions, which increases rates of biochemical reactions associated with zooxanthellar photosynthesis, producing toxic forms of oxygen that interfere with cellular processes. Published projections of a baseline of increasing ocean temperature resulting from global warming have suggested that annual temperature maxima within 30 years may be at levels that will cause frequent coral bleaching and widespread mortality leading to decline of corals as dominant organisms on reefs. However, these projections have not considered the high variability in bleaching response that occurs among corals both within and among species. There is information that corals and their symbionts may be capable of acclimatization and selective adaptation to elevated temperatures that have already resulted in bleaching resistant coral populations, both locally and regionally, in various areas of the world. There are possible mechanisms that might provide resistance and protection to increased temperature and light. These include inducible heat shock proteins that act in refolding denatured cellular and structural proteins, production of oxidative enzymes that inactivate harmful oxygen radicals, fluorescent coral pigments that both reflect and dissipate light energy, and phenotypic adaptations of zooxanthellae and adaptive shifts in their populations at higher temperatures. Such mechanisms, when considered in conjunction with experimental and observational evidence for coral recovery in areas that have undergone coral bleaching, suggest an as yet undefined capacity in corals and zooxanthellae to adapt to conditions that have induced coral bleaching. Clearly, there are limits to acclimatory processes that can counter coral bleaching resulting from elevated sea temperatures, but scientific models will not accurately predict the fate of reef corals until we have a better understanding of coral-algal acclimatization/adaptation potential. Research is particularly needed with respect to the molecular and physiological mechanisms that promote thermal tolerance in corals and zooxanthellae and identification of genetic characteristics responsible for the variety of responses that occur in a coral bleaching event. Only then will we have some idea of the nature of likely responses, the timescales involved and the role of ‘experience’ in modifying bleaching impact.},

	abstract = {Recent excitement over the development of an initiative to generate {DNA} sequences for all named species on the planet has in our opinion generated two major areas of contention as to how this ‘{DNA} barcoding’ initiative should proceed. It is critical that these two issues are clarified and resolved, before the use of {DNA} as a tool for taxonomy and species delimitation can be universalized. The first issue concerns how {DNA} data are to be used in the context of this initiative; this is the {DNA} barcode reader problem (or barcoder problem). Currently, many of the published studies under this initiative have used tree building methods and more precisely distance approaches to the construction of the trees that are used to place certain {DNA} sequences into a taxonomic context. The second problem involves the reaction of the taxonomic community to the directives of the ‘{DNA} barcoding’ initiative. This issue is extremely important in that the classical taxonomic approach and the {DNA} approach will need to be reconciled in order for the ‘{DNA} barcoding’ initiative to proceed with any kind of community acceptance. In fact, we feel that {DNA} barcoding is a misnomer. Our preference is for the title of the London meetings—Barcoding Life. In this paper we discuss these two concerns generated around the {DNA} barcoding initiative and attempt to present a phylogenetic systematic framework for an improved barcoder as well as a taxonomic framework for interweaving classical taxonomy with the goals of ‘{DNA} barcoding’.},

A protocol is described for rapidly generating large blocks of 16S {rRNA} sequence data without isolation of the 16S {rRNA} or cloning of its gene. The 16S {rRNA} in bulk cellular {RNA} preparations is selectively targeted for dideoxynucleotide-terminated sequencing by using reverse transcriptase and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers complementary to universally conserved 16S {rRNA} sequences. Three particularly useful priming sites, which provide access to the three major 16S {rRNA} structural domains, routinely yield 800-1000 nucleotides of 16S {rRNA} sequence. The method is evaluated with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to modified nucleotides in the template {RNA}, and phylogenetic usefulness, by examination of several 16S {rRNAs} whose gene sequences are known. The relative simplicity of this approach should facilitate a rapid expansion of the 16S {rRNA} sequence collection available for phylogenetic analyses.},

It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed on a Biologist's {PC} workstation within reasonable time is limited to trees containing approximately 100 taxa.
Results: In this paper we present the latest release of our program {RAxML}-{III} for rapid maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours on a single {PC} processor. We compare {RAxML}-{III} to the currently fastest implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: {PHYML} and {MrBayes}. Whereas {RAxML}-{III} performs worse than {PHYML} and {MrBayes} on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.

	abstract = {{DNA} barcoding-type studies assemble single-locus data from large samples of individuals and species, and have provided new kinds of data for evolutionary surveys of diversity. An important goal of many such studies is to delimit evolutionarily significant species units, especially in biodiversity surveys from environmental {DNA} samples. The Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent ({GMYC}) method is a likelihood method for delimiting species by fitting within- and between-species branching models to reconstructed gene trees. Although the method has been widely used, it has not previously been described in detail or evaluated fully against simulations of alternative scenarios of true patterns of population variation and divergence between species. Here, we present important reformulations to the {GMYC} method as originally specified, and demonstrate its robustness to a range of departures from its simplifying assumptions. The main factor affecting the accuracy of delimitation is the mean population size of species relative to divergence times between them. Other departures from the model assumptions, such as varying population sizes among species, alternative scenarios for speciation and extinction, and population growth or subdivision within species, have relatively smaller effects. Our simulations demonstrate that support measures derived from the likelihood function provide a robust indication of when the model performs well and when it leads to inaccurate delimitations. Finally, the so-called single-threshold version of the method outperforms the multiple-threshold version of the method on simulated data: we argue that this might represent a fundamental limit due to the nature of evidence used to delimit species in this approach. Together with other studies comparing its performance relative to other methods, our findings support the robustness of {GMYC} as a tool for delimiting species when only single-locus information is available.

	abstract = {Background. We investigated an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection among {US} service members injured in Iraq.
Methods. The investigation was conducted in Iraq and Kuwait, in the 2 military hospitals where the majority of injured service members were initially treated. After initially characterizing the outbreak, we evaluated 3 potential sources of infection for the period March 2003 to December 2004. The evaluation included screening samples that were obtained from the skin of patients for the presence of colonization and assessing the soil and health care environments for the presence of A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms. Isolates obtained from samples from patients in {US} Military treatment facilities, as well as environmental isolates, were genotypically characterized and compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
Results. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms were present on the skin in only 1 (0.6\%) of 160 patients who were screened and in 1 (2\%) of 49 soil samples. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex isolates were recovered from treatment areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we identified 5 cluster groups in which isolates from patients were related to environmental isolates. One cluster included hospitalized patients who had not been deployed to Iraq. Among the clinical isolates, only imipenem, polymyxin B, and colistin demonstrated reliable in vitro antimicrobial activity. Generally, the environmental isolates were more drug susceptible than were the clinical isolates.
Conclusions. Our findings suggest that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection transmission within health care facilities played a major role in this outbreak. On the basis of these findings, maintaining infection control throughout the military health care system is essential. Novel strategies may be required to prevent the transmission of pathogens in combat field hospitals.},

Completely surveyed communities follow log-normal distribution, whereas power law functions best describe incompletely censused communities. It is arguable whether the statistics behind those theories can be applied to voluminous next generation sequencing data in microbiology by treating individual {DNA} sequences as counts of molecular taxonomic units ({MOTUs}). This study addresses the suitability of species abundance models in three groups of plant-associated fungal communities – phyllosphere, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We tested the impact of differential treatment of molecular singletons on observed and estimated species richness and species abundance distribution models. The arbuscular mycorrhizal community of 48 {MOTUs} was exhaustively sampled and followed log-normal distribution. The ectomycorrhizal (153 {MOTUs}) and phyllosphere (327 {MOTUs}) communities significantly differed from log-normal distribution. The fungal phyllosphere community in particular was clearly undersampled. This undersampling bias resulted in strong sensitivity to the exclusion of molecular singletons and other rare {MOTUs} that may represent technical artefacts. The analysis of abundant (core) and rare (satellite) {MOTUs} clearly identified two species abundance distributions in the phyllosphere data – a log-normal model for the core group and a log-series model for the satellite group. The prominent log-series distribution of satellite phyllosphere fungi highlighted the ecological significance of an infrequent fungal component in the phyllosphere community.},

Although it has been reported that particular outbreak strains are geographically widespread, little is known about the diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of A. baumannii clonal groups. Sequencing of internal portions of seven housekeeping genes (total 2,976 nt) was performed in 154 A. baumannii strains covering the breadth of known diversity and including representatives of previously recognized international clones, and in 19 representatives of other Acinetobacter species. Restricted amounts of diversity and a star-like phylogeny reveal that A. baumannii is a genetically compact species that suffered a severe bottleneck in the recent past, possibly linked to a restricted ecological niche. A. baumannii is neatly demarcated from its closest relative (genomic species 13TU) and other Acinetobacter species. Multilocus sequence typing analysis demonstrated that the previously recognized international clones I to {III} correspond to three clonal complexes, each made of a central, predominant genotype and few single locus variants, a hallmark of recent clonal expansion. Whereas antimicrobial resistance was almost universal among isolates of these and a novel international clone ({ST}15), isolates of the other genotypes were mostly susceptible. This dichotomy indicates that antimicrobial resistance is a major selective advantage that drives the ongoing rapid clonal expansion of these highly problematic agents of nosocomial infections.},

Virology is now a growing field of science in coral reef research, largely related to an increase in the frequency of coral bleaching events and other coral diseases. Because viruses are obligate symbionts, they are generally perceived as parasitic and harmful to their hosts. However, evidence that viruses confer benefits to their hosts is growing and their role as mutualists is emerging. Here we review both the detrimental and beneficial aspects of viral infections and argue that as the field of coral virology expands, in addition to their pathogenicity, the idea that viruses represent functionally beneficial components of the coral holobiont be considered.},

	abstract = {Population studies have revealed that the fungal ectomycorrhizal morphospecies Tricholoma scalpturatum consists of at least two genetically distinct groups that occur sympatrically in several geographical areas. This discovery prompted us to examine species boundaries and relationships between members formerly assigned to T. scalpturatum and allied taxa using phylogenetic analyses. Sequence data were obtained from three nuclear {DNA} regions [internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}), gpd and tef], from 101 carpophores collected over a large geographical range in Western Europe, and some reference sequences from public databases. The {ITS} was also tested for its applicability as {DNA} barcode for species delimitation. Four highly supported phylogenetic clades were detected. The two previously detected genetic groups of T. scalpturatum were assigned to the phylospecies Tricholoma argyraceum and T. scalpturatum. The two remaining clades were referred to as Tricholoma cingulatum and Tricholoma inocybeoides. Unexpectedly, T. cingulatum showed an accelerated rate of evolution that we attributed to narrow host specialization. This study also reveals recombinant {ITS} sequences in T. inocybeoides, suggesting a hybrid origin. The {ITS} was a useful tool for the determination of species boundaries: the mean value of intraspecific genetic distances in the entire {ITS} region (including 5.8S {rDNA}) was {\textless}0.2\%, whereas interspecific divergence estimates ranged from 1.78\% to 4.22\%. Apart from giving insights into the evolution of the T. scalpturatum complex, this study contributes to the establishment of a library of taxonomically verified voucher specimens, an a posteriori correlation between phenotype and genotype, and {DNA} barcoding of ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). * • Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 ({ITS}-1). No less than 166 350 {ITS} reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. * • Most operational taxonomic units (81\%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The {ITS}-1 sequences (73\%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. * • This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although the number of studies investigating mycorrhizal associations in orchids has increased in recent years, the fungal communities associating with orchids and how they differ between species and sites remain unclear. Recent research has indicated that individual orchid plants may associate with several fungi concurrently, implying that to study mycorrhizal associations in orchids the fungal community should be assessed, rather than the presence of individual dominant fungal species or strains. High-throughput sequencing methods, such as 454 pyrosequencing, are increasingly used as the primary tool for such analyses. However, many studies combine universal primers from previous phylogenetic or ecological studies to generate amplicons suitable for 454 pyrosequencing without first critically evaluating their performance, potentially resulting in biased fungal community descriptions. Here, following in silico primer analysis we evaluated the performance of different combinations of existing {PCR} primers to characterize orchid mycorrhizal communities using 454 pyrosequencing by analysis of both an artificially assembled community of mycorrhizal fungi isolated from diverse orchid species and root samples from three different orchid species (Anacamptis morio, Ophrys tenthredinifera and Serapias lingua). Our results indicate that primer pairs {ITS}3/{ITS}4OF and {ITS}86F/{ITS}4, targeting the internal transcribed spacer-2 ({ITS}-2) region, outperformed other tested primer pairs in terms of number of reads, number of operational taxonomic units recovered from the artificial community and number of different orchid mycorrhizal associating families detected in the orchid samples. Additionally, we show the complementary specificity of both primer pairs, making them highly suitable for tandem use when studying the diversity of orchid mycorrhizal communities.},

Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory ({RAM}) occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus ({OLC}) assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which {SOAPdenovo} is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential information for the improvement of existing assemblers or the developing of novel assemblers.},

In this study, we established molecular techniques in order to identify fine roots of the 30 most common tree species of the Alps. We developed a protocol for efficient isolation of {DNA} from fine roots with extraction of {DNA} in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone ({PVP}) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone ({PVPP}). The {trnL} ({UAA}) intron of plastid {DNA} was used as a marker for fine root identification. We amplified and sequenced this intron with plant universal primers. The size of the sequences ranged from 444 to 672 bp. A synoptic key for species identification was designed on the basis of restriction fragment patterns predicted from sequence data. Using the restriction enzyme {TaqI} as key enzyme, and where necessary {HinfI}, {RsaI} and {CfoI}, 16 taxa, including Picea abies, Larix decidua, Abies alba, and Fagus sylvatica, the dominant tree species of the Alpine region could be identified by agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction fragments. Fourteen taxa could be identified to the genus level, among them Quercus, Salix and Populus species. In a field study, conducted in a 20 × 30 m plot of a mixed forest with five tree species, fine roots of 43 out of 46 samples were identified and their distributions were mapped.

	abstract = {Next generation {DNA} sequencing ({NGS}) approaches are rapidly surpassing Sanger sequencing for characterizing the diversity of natural microbial communities. Despite this rapid transition, few comparisons exist between Sanger sequences and the generally much shorter reads of {NGS}. Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs}) derived from full-length (Sanger sequencing) and pyrotag (454 sequencing of the V9 hypervariable region) sequences of 18S {rRNA} gene from ten global samples were analyzed in order to compare the resulting protistan community structure and species richness. Pyrotag {OTUs} called at 98\% sequence similarity yielded similar overall numbers of {OTUs} as full-length sequences when the latter were called at 97\% similarity. Singleton {OTUs} strongly influenced estimates of species richness but not higher-level taxonomic composition of the community. The pyrotag and full-length sequence dataset had slightly different taxonomic composition of rhizarians, stramenopiles, cryptophytes, and haptophytes, but both datasets had similarly high composition of alveolates. Pyrotag {OTUs} with the most pyrotag sequences were comprised of pyrotags that mapped at 100\% similarity to multiple full-length {OTUs}. Thus, pyrotags sequenced from a single hypervariable region might not be appropriate for establishing protistan species-level {OTUs}. However, nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots constructed with the two datasets yielded similar clusters, indicating that beta diversity analysis results were similar for both Sanger and {NGS} sequences. Short pyrotag sequences can provide holistic assessments of protistan communities, although care must be taken when interpreting the results. Longer reads ({\textgreater} 500 bp) now becoming available through {NGS} should provide powerful tools for assessing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic assemblages.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based forest simulator (a gap model) to assess the potential effects of anthropogenic climatic change on conifer forests of the Pacific Northwestern United States. Steady-state simulations suggested that forest zones could be shifted on the order of 500–1000 m in elevation, which could lead to the local extirpation of some high-altitude species. For low-elevation sites, species which currently are more abundant hundreds of kilometers to the south would be favored under greenhouse scenarios. Simulations of transient responses suggested that forest stands could show complex responses depending on initial species composition, stand age and canopy development, and the magnitude and duration of climatic warming. Assumptions about species response to temperature, which are crucial to the model's behaviors, were evaluated using data on species temperature limits inferred from regional distributions. The high level of within-species variability in these data, and other confounding factors influencing species distributions, argue against over-interpreting simulations. We suggest how we might resolve critical uncertainties with further research.},

Due to their significant economic and environmental impact, there has been increasing interest in Phytophthora genetics and genomics, culminating in the recent release of three complete genome sequences (P. ramorum, P. sojae, and P. infestans). In this study, genome and other large sequence databases were used to identify over 225 potential genetic markers for phylogenetic analyses. Here, we present a genus-wide phylogeny for 82 Phytophthora species using seven of the most informative loci (approximately 8700 nucleotide sites). Our results support the division of the genus into 10 well-supported clades. The relationships among these clades were rigorously evaluated using a number of phylogenetic methods. This is the most comprehensive study of Phytophthora relationships to date, and many newly discovered species have been included. A more resolved phylogeny of Phytophthora species will allow for better interpretations of the overall evolutionary history of the genus.},

	abstract = {The {DNA} barcoding technology uses a standard region of {DNA} sequence for species identification and discovery. At present, “{DNA} barcode” actually refers to {DNA} sequences, which are not amenable to information storage, recognition, and retrieval. Our aim is to identify the best symbology that can represent {DNA} barcode sequences in practical applications. A comprehensive set of sequences for five {DNA} barcode markers {ITS}2, {rbcL}, {matK}, {psbA}-{trnH}, and {CO}1 was used as the test data. Fifty-three different types of one-dimensional and ten two-dimensional barcode symbologies were compared based on different criteria, such as coding capacity, compression efficiency, and error detection ability. The quick response ({QR}) code was found to have the largest coding capacity and relatively high compression ratio. To facilitate the further usage of {QR} code-based {DNA} barcodes, a web server was developed and is accessible at http://qrfordna.dnsalias.org. The web server allows users to retrieve the {QR} code for a species of interests, convert a {DNA} sequence to and from a {QR} code, and perform species identification based on local and global sequence similarities. In summary, the first comprehensive evaluation of various barcode symbologies has been carried out. The {QR} code has been found to be the most appropriate symbology for {DNA} barcode sequences. A web server has also been constructed to allow biologists to utilize {QR} codes in practical {DNA} barcoding applications.},

	abstract = {Cataloging the very large number of undescribed species of insects could be greatly accelerated by automated {DNA} based approaches, but procedures for large-scale species discovery from sequence data are currently lacking. Here, we use mitochondrial {DNA} variation to delimit species in a poorly known beetle radiation in the genus Rivacindela from arid Australia. Among 468 individuals sampled from 65 sites and multiple morphologically distinguishable types, sequence variation in three {mtDNA} genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, cytochrome b, 16S ribosomal {RNA}) was strongly partitioned between 46 or 47 putative species identified with quantitative methods of species recognition based on fixed unique (“diagnostic”) characters. The boundaries between groups were also recognizable from a striking increase in branching rate in clock-constrained calibrated trees. Models of stochastic lineage growth (Yule models) were combined with coalescence theory to develop a new likelihood method that determines the point of transition from species-level (speciation and extinction) to population-level (coalescence) evolutionary processes. Fitting the location of the switches from speciation to coalescent nodes on the ultrametric tree of Rivacindela produced a transition in branching rate occurring at 0.43 Mya, leading to an estimate of 48 putative species (confidence interval for the threshold ranging from 47 to 51 clusters within 2 {logL} units). Entities delimited in this way exhibited biological properties of traditionally defined species, showing coherence of geographic ranges, broad congruence with morphologically recognized species, and levels of sequence divergence typical for closely related species of insects. The finding of discontinuous evolutionary groupings that are readily apparent in patterns of sequence variation permits largely automated species delineation from {DNA} surveys of local communities as a scaffold for taxonomy in this poorly known insect group.},

Disruptions in these associations have been correlated with coral disease, but little is known about the series of events involved in the shift from mutualism to pathogenesis. To evaluate structural and functional changes in coral microbial communities, Porites compressa was exposed to four stressors: increased temperature, elevated nutrients, dissolved organic carbon loading and reduced {pH}. Microbial metagenomic samples were collected and pyrosequenced. Functional gene analysis demonstrated that stressors increased the abundance of microbial genes involved in virulence, stress resistance, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, motility and chemotaxis, fatty acid and lipid utilization, and secondary metabolism. Relative changes in taxonomy also demonstrated that coral-associated microbiota (Archaea, Bacteria, protists) shifted from a healthy-associated coral community (e.g. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and the zooxanthellae Symbiodinium) to a community (e.g. Bacteriodetes, Fusobacteria and Fungi) of microbes often found on diseased corals. Additionally, low-abundance Vibrio spp. were found to significantly alter microbiome metabolism, suggesting that the contribution of a just a few members of a community can profoundly shift the health status of the coral holobiont.},

Microorganisms comprise the majority of the biodiversity on the planet. Because the overwhelming majority of microbes are not readily cultured in the laboratory, researchers often rely on {PCR}-based investigations of genomic sequence to characterize microbial diversity. These analyses have dramatically expanded our understanding of biodiversity, but due to methodological biases {PCR}-based approaches may only reveal part of the microbial biosphere. Shotgun sequencing of environmental {DNA}, known as metagenomics, avoids the biases associated with targeted amplification of genomic sequence and can provide insight into the diversity hidden from traditional investigations. However, the fragmentary, non-overlapping nature of shotgun sequence data makes it intractable to analyze with existing tools. Here, we present {PhylOTU}, a novel computational method that enables accurate characterization of microbial diversity from metagenomic data. We process over 10 million metagenomic sequences obtained from the global open ocean to identify novel Bacterial taxa and reveal the presence of microorganisms overlooked by investigation of {PCR}-based sequences from the same samples. These results suggest that to fully characterize microbial biodiversity requires a novel bioinformatics toolbox for analysis of shotgun metagenomic data.},

We compared the recent de novo assemblies using the short oligonucleotide analysis package ({SOAP}), generated from the genomes of a Han Chinese individual and a Yoruban individual, to experimentally validated genomic features. We found that de novo assemblies were 16.2\% shorter than the reference genome and that 420.2 megabase pairs of common repeats and 99.1\% of validated duplicated sequences were missing from the genome. Consequently, over 2,377 coding exons were completely missing.

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing technologies have revolutionized how we describe and compare complex microbial communities. In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R2 of 0.96–0.54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but between-species comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data.},

Results Imipenem non-susceptibility was associated with {ISAba}1 upstream of the intrinsic {blaOXA}-51-like or the acquired carbapenemase {blaOXA}-23-like, {blaOXA}-40-like or {blaOXA}-58-like. Isolates were grouped into eight distinct clusters including European clones I, {II} and {III}. European clone {II} was the largest (246 isolates) and most widespread group ({USA}, pan-Europe, Israel, Asia, Australia and South Africa).
Conclusions The global dissemination of eight carbapenem-resistant lineages illustrates the success this organism has had in epidemic spread. The acquired {OXA} enzymes are widely distributed but are not the sole carbapenem resistance determinant in A. baumannii.},

	abstract = {We introduce Dirichlet multinomial mixtures ({DMM}) for the probabilistic modelling of microbial metagenomics data. This data can be represented as a frequency matrix giving the number of times each taxa is observed in each sample. The samples have different size, and the matrix is sparse, as communities are diverse and skewed to rare taxa. Most methods used previously to classify or cluster samples have ignored these features. We describe each community by a vector of taxa probabilities. These vectors are generated from one of a finite number of Dirichlet mixture components each with different hyperparameters. Observed samples are generated through multinomial sampling. The mixture components cluster communities into distinct ‘metacommunities’, and, hence, determine envirotypes or enterotypes, groups of communities with a similar composition. The model can also deduce the impact of a treatment and be used for classification. We wrote software for the fitting of {DMM} models using the ‘evidence framework’ (http://code.google.com/p/microbedmm/). This includes the Laplace approximation of the model evidence. We applied the {DMM} model to human gut microbe genera frequencies from Obese and Lean twins. From the model evidence four clusters fit this data best. Two clusters were dominated by Bacteroides and were homogenous; two had a more variable community composition. We could not find a significant impact of body mass on community structure. However, Obese twins were more likely to derive from the high variance clusters. We propose that obesity is not associated with a distinct microbiota but increases the chance that an individual derives from a disturbed enterotype. This is an example of the ‘Anna Karenina principle ({AKP})’ applied to microbial communities: disturbed states having many more configurations than undisturbed. We verify this by showing that in a study of inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) phenotypes, ileal Crohn's disease ({ICD}) is associated with a more variable community.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to investigate arbuscular mycorrhizal status of five species of rhododendrons distributed in Kumaun region of the Indian Central Himalaya. Root and rhizosphere soil samples of all the five species of rhododendrons, namely, Rhododendron anthopogon, R. arboreum, R. campanulatum, R. barbatum and R. lepidotum were collected from temperate, sub-alpine to alpine location in altitudinal range from 1500 to 4500 m amsl. The arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in root samples ranged from 28 to 42\%; and maximum and minimum colonization was observed in R. arboreum and R. lepidotum, respectively. The highest number of intraradical vesicles (12.5 ± 2.8 cm−1 root segment) was recorded in R. arboreum and the lowest (7.0 ± 1.7 cm−1 root segment) in R. barbatum; vesicles were not observed in R. lepidotum. Spores were extracted from the rhizosphere soil by wet sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species. The maximum and minimum populations of spores were detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of R. anthopogon (52.0 ± 1.5 spores 25 g−1 soil) and R. lepidotum (32.0 ± 2.5 spore 25 g−1 soil), respectively. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera—Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellispora; genus Glomus was found to be dominant in the rhizosphere soil samples of all the rhododendron species. The most frequent and abundant species was G. fasciculatum, however, this species was not isolated from the rhizosphere soil of R. barbatum. Finger millet (Eleucine coracana) was used to cultivate the trap culture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to confirm the species identity. Spores of Glomus pustulatum, not detected in the rhizosphere soil, were recovered from the trap culture. Contrary to this, genus Gigaspora, which was present in the rhizosphere soil, did not sporulate in the trap culture. Shannon and Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's index of dominance indicated that the species richness, dominance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decrease with increasing altitude. In two species of rhododendrons, namely R. campanulatum and R. anthopogon, dark septate mycelium was also observed.},

	abstract = {Various combinations of antibiotics are reported to show synergy in treating nosocomial infections with multidrug-resistant ({MDR}) Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii). Here, we studied hospital-acquired outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii to evaluate optimal combinations of antibiotics. One hundred and twenty-one strains were grouped into one major and one minor clonal group based on repetitive {PCR} amplification. Twenty representative strains were tested for antibiotic synergy using Etest®. Five strains were further analyzed by analytical isoelectric focusing and {PCR} to identify β-lactamase genes or other antibiotic resistance determinants. Our investigation showed that the outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii belonged to two dominant clones. A combination of colistin and doxycycline showed the best result, being additive or synergistic against 70\% of tested strains. Antibiotic additivity was observed more frequently than synergy. Strains possessing the same clonality did not necessarily demonstrate the same response to antibiotic combinations in vitro. We conclude that the effect of antibiotic combinations on our outbreak strains of {MDR} A. baumannii seemed strain-specific. The bacterial response to antibiotic combinations is probably a result of complex interactions between multiple concomitant antibiotic resistance determinants in each strain.},

These {VLPs} had similar morphologies to known prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in other systems. Icosahedral {VLPs} were observed most frequently, however, filamentous {VLPs} ({FVLPs}) and phage were also noted. There were no clear differences in {VLP} size, morphology or location within the tissues with respect to sample date, coral health status or site. The most common {VLP} morphotype exhibited icosahedral symmetry, 120–150 nm in diameter, with an electron-dense core and an electronlucent membrane. Larger {VLPs} of similar morphology were also common. {VLPs} occurred as single entities, in groups, or in dense clusters, either as free particles within coral tissues, or within membrane-bound vacuoles. {VLPs} were commonly observed within the perinuclear region, with mitochondria, golgi apparatus and crescent-shaped particles frequently observed within close proximity. The host(s) of these observed {VLPs} was not clear; however, the different sizes and morphologies of {VLPs} observed within A. muricata tissues suggest that viruses are infecting either the coral animal, zooxanthellae, intracellular bacteria and/or other coral-associated microbiota, or that the one host is susceptible to infection from more than one type of virus. These results add to the limited but emerging body of evidence that viruses represent another potentially important component of the coral holobiont.},

Eighteen isolates that were morphologically distinct were selected for identification by sequencing the {ITS} region. For culture-independent analysis, the {DNA} was isolated from the surface-sterilized leaves of R. tomentosum and the {ITS} region was amplified using fungal specific primers {ITS}1F and {ITS}4, cloned, and 11 clones were randomly selected and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis was performed with {MEGA}4 on a total of 49 sequences, including 18 endophytic isolates and 11 unculturables obtained in this study, and 20 sequences from Genbank, which were distributed in four clusters. The culturable and unculturable endophytes formed separate clades and were clearly distinguishable with no overlap within the groups. Endophytic fungi are a well-recognized source of bioactive compounds and therefore antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the isolates of R. tomentosum were studied. All isolates were grown in two different media, enriched ({MEB}) and depleted ({DM}), and screened for antibacterial and antioxidant activities. As a result, 10\% produced antibacterials and 14\% antioxidants, in total 24\% of the isolates had biological activity. Antioxidant broth of {TRT}59 was partially purified using {HPLC}. The majority of antibacterial compounds were produced in {DM} media and antioxidants in {MEB} media.

Methods and Results Pyrosequencing of Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 ({ITS}1) amplicons was used to describe the structure of a {DNA} mixture comprising eight Phytophthora spp. and Pythium vexans. Pyrosequencing resulted in 16 965 reads, detecting all species in the template {DNA} mixture. Reducing the {ITS}1 sequence identity threshold resulted in a decrease in numbers of unmatched reads but a concomitant increase in the numbers of false {MOTUs}. The total error rate was 0·63\% and comprised mainly mismatches (0·25\%) Conclusions Pyrosequencing of {ITS}1 region is an efficient and accurate technique for the detection and identification of Phytophthora spp. in environmental samples. However, the risk of allocating false {MOTUs}, even when demonstrated to be low, may require additional validation with alternative detection methods. Significance and Impact of the Study Phytophthora spp. are considered among the most destructive groups of invasive plant pathogens, affecting thousands of cultivated and wild plants worldwide. Simultaneous early detection of Phytophthora complexes in environmental samples offers an unique opportunity for the interception of known and unknown species along pathways of introduction, along with the identification of these organisms in invaded environments.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics is a recent field of biology that studies microbial communities by analyzing their genomic content directly sequenced from the environment. A metagenomic dataset consists of many short {DNA} or {RNA} fragments called reads. One interesting problem in metagenomic data analysis is the discovery of the taxonomic composition of a given dataset. A simple method for this task, called the Lowest Common Ancestor ({LCA}), is employed in state-of-the-art computational tools for metagenomic data analysis of very short reads (about 100 bp). However {LCA} has two main drawbacks: it possibly assigns many reads to high taxonomic ranks and it discards a high number of reads.
Results: We present {MTR}, a new method for tackling these drawbacks using clustering at Multiple Taxonomic Ranks. Unlike {LCA}, which processes the reads one-by-one, {MTR} exploits information shared by reads. Specifically, {MTR} consists of two main phases. First, for each taxonomic rank, a collection of potential clusters of reads is generated, and each potential cluster is associated to a taxon at that rank. Next, a small number of clusters is selected at each rank using a combinatorial optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the resulting method is tested on a large number of simulated and real-life metagenomes. Results of experiments show that {MTR} improves on {LCA} by discarding a significantly smaller number of reads and by assigning much more reads at lower taxonomic ranks. Moreover, {MTR} provides a more faithful taxonomic characterization of the metagenome population distribution.

	volume = {182},
	issn = {0021-9193},
	abstract = {The alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase ({ALDC}) gene, {aldB}, is the penultimate gene of the leu-ilv-ald operon, which encodes the three branched-chain amino acid ({BCAA}) biosynthesis genes in Lactococcus lactis. Its product plays a dual role in the cell: (i) it catalyzes the second step of the acetoin pathway, and (ii) it controls the pool of alpha-acetolactate during leucine and valine synthesis. It can be transcribed from the two promoters present upstream of the leu and ilv genes (P1 and P2) or independently under the control of its own promoter (P3). In this paper we show that the production of {ALDC} is limited by two mechanisms. First, the strength of P3 decreases greatly during starvation for {BCAAs} and under other conditions that generally provoke the stringent response. Second, although {aldB} is actively transcribed from P1 and P2 during {BCAA} starvation, {ALDC} is not significantly produced from these transcripts. The {aldB} ribosome binding site ({RBS}) appears to be entrapped in a stem-loop, which is itself part of a more complex {RNA} folding structure. The function of the structure was studied by mutagenesis, using translational fusions with luciferase genes to assess its activity. The presence of the single stem-loop entrapping the {aldB} {RBS} was responsible for a 100-fold decrease in the level of {aldB} translation. The presence of a supplementary secondary structure upstream of the stem-loop led to an additional fivefold decrease of {aldB} translation. Finally, the translation of the {ilvA} gene terminating in the latter structure decreased the level of translation of {aldB} fivefold more, leading to the complete extinction of the reporter gene activity. Since three leucines and one valine are present among the last six amino acids of the {ilvA} product, we propose that pausing of the ribosomes during translation could modulate the folding of the messenger, as a function of {BCAA} availability. The purpose of the structure-dependent regulation could be to ensure the minimal production of {ALDC} required for the control of the acetolactate pool during {BCAA} synthesis but to avoid its overproduction, which would dissipate acetolactate. Large amounts of {ALDC}, necessary for operation of the acetoin pathway, could be produced under favorable conditions from the P3 transcripts, which do not contain the secondary structures.},

	abstract = {Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures.
For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species.
Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method ({BEST} 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both {BEST} and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms {BEST} in divergence time and population size estimation.},

	abstract = {Current molecular detection methods for the genus Phytophthora are specific to a few key species rather than the whole genus and this is a recognized weakness of protocols for ecological studies and international plant health legislation. In the present study a molecular approach was developed to detect Phytophthora species in soil and water samples using novel sets of genus-specific primers designed against the internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) regions. Two different {rDNA} primer sets were tested: one assay amplified a long product including the {ITS}1, 5.8S and {ITS}2 regions ({LP}) and the other a shorter product including the {ITS}1 only ({SP}). Both assays specifically amplified products from Phytophthora species without cross-reaction with the related Pythium s. lato, however the {SP} assay proved the more sensitive and reliable. The method was validated using woodland soil and stream water from Invergowrie, Scotland. On-site use of a knapsack sprayer and in-line water filters proved more rapid and effective than centrifugation at sampling Phytophthora propagules. A total of 15 different Phytophthora phylotypes were identified which clustered within the reported {ITS}-clades 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. The range and type of the sequences detected varied from sample to sample and up to three and five different Phytophthora phylotypes were detected within a single sample of soil or water, respectively. The most frequently detected sequences were related to members of {ITS}-clade 6 (i.e. P. gonapodyides-like). The new method proved very effective at discriminating multiple species in a given sample and can also detect as yet unknown species. The reported primers and methods will prove valuable for ecological studies, biosecurity and commercial plant, soil or water (e.g. irrigation water) testing as well as the wider metagenomic sampling of this fascinating component of microbial pathogen diversity.},

Here we use a Bayesian modeling approach to generate the posterior probabilities of species assignments taking account of uncertainties due to unknown gene trees and the ancestral coalescent process. For tractability, we rely on a user-specified guide tree to avoid integrating over all possible species delimitations. The statistical performance of the method is examined using simulations, and the method is illustrated by analyzing sequence data from rotifers, fence lizards, and human populations.},

Here we compare the two {ITS} regions, {ITS}-1 and {ITS}-2, of the fungal populations occurring in Tuber melanosporum/Quercus pubescens truffle grounds and sampled in two areas, one devoid of vegetation (“burned”, brulé in French) where T. melanosporum fruiting bodies are usually collected, and outside the brulé. {TS}1F/{ITS}2 and {ITS}3/{ITS}4 were used respectively for the amplification of the {ITS}-1 and {ITS}-2 regions. Two amplicon libraries were built, one for inside and the other for outside. A set of 15.788 reads was obtained. After the removal of low quality sequences, 3568 and 3156 sequences were obtained from inside the brulé with the {ITS}-1 and {ITS}-2 primers respectively. The sequences obtained from outside the brulé were 4490 with the {ITS}-1 primers and 2432 with the {ITS}-2 primers. Most of the sequences obtained for both {ITS} fragments could be attributed to fungal organisms.
The pair of primers, {ITS}1-F/{ITS}2, was more selective, producing fewer non-fungal sequences (1\% inside, 3\% outside), in addition to a higher number of sequences, than the pair {ITS}3/{ITS}4 (6\% inside, 11\% outside). Although differences are present in the taxa percentages between {ITS}-1 and {ITS}-2, both reveal that Ascomycota were the dominant fungal phylum and that their number decreased moving from inside the brulé to outside, while the number of Basidiomycota increased. Taken together, both the short {ITS}-1 and {ITS}-2 reads obtained by the high throughput 454 sequencing provide adequate information for taxon assignment and are suitable to correlate the dynamics of the fungal populations to specific environments.},

	abstract = {Computer models designed to simulate the dynamics of a
forest by following the fates of each individual tree in a
forest stand were created initially in the mid-1960s. The
earliest such model was built by Newnham (1964), followed
by similar developments in several Schools of Forestry in the
{US}. These early models involved using a digital computer
to dynamically change a map of the sizes and positions of
each tree in a simulated forest. Importantly, these initial
models were as complex and as detailed as their present day
descendants. With increased computing power becoming
cheap and available, applications using these models have
become increasingly frequent (Shugart and West, 1980).
Gap models simulate the changes in a small patch of
forest on the order of 0.1 ha in size. The models project
the annual growth of each individual tree on the patch
as well as the death of each tree and the regeneration of
new individual trees. Gap models are important because
of their widespread applications in assessing the effects of
environmental change on forests. The models have been
applied to develop theories about the overall functioning of
forested landscape and have also been used to reconstruct
the composition of forests of the past and under future
conditions.
Gap models are a special case of the more general
individual-based models. They have been used particularly
for forest ecosystems. Because gap models have been
applied in a very wide range of ecosystems, often the term,
gap model, is used interchangeably with other individualbased
models when applied to mixed age and multi-species
ecosystems. The models simulate landscapes as dynamically
changing mosaics with each element of the mosaic having an
interactive population of trees of different species and sizes.
Output from the models resembles field data as sampled
from a standard forest survey unit: a list of the diameters
of each tree (and its species) alive on the patch for each
year. These model data can be transformed to estimates
of biomass (and hence, net production), leaf area profiles
through the canopy, and tree ring histories for each tree.},

	abstract = {In research labs, there is often a need to customise software at every step in a given bioinformatics workflow, but traditionally it has been difficult to obtain both a high degree of customisability and good performance. Performance-sensitive tools are often highly monolithic, which can make research difficult. We present a novel set of software development principles and a bioinformatics framework, Friedrich, which is currently in early development. Friedrich applications support both early stage experimentation and late stage batch processing, since they simultaneously allow for good performance and a high degree of flexibility and customisability. These benefits are obtained in large part by basing Friedrich on the multiparadigm programming language Scala. We present a case study in the form of a basic genome assembler and its extension with new functionality. Our architecture has the potential to greatly increase the overall productivity of software developers and researchers in bioinformatics.},

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing analysis was performed on soils from Italian chestnut groves to evaluate the diversity of the resident Phytophthora community. Sequences analysed with a custom database discriminated 15 pathogenic Phytophthoras including species common to chestnut soils, while a total of nine species were detected with baiting. The two sites studied differed in Phytophthora diversity and the presence of specific taxa responded to specific ecological traits of the sites. Furthermore, some species not previously recorded were represented by a discrete number of reads; among these species, Phytophthora ramorum was detected at both sites. Pyrosequencing was demonstrated to be a very sensitive technique to describe the Phytophthora community in soil and was able to detect species not easy to be isolated from soil with standard baiting techniques. In particular, pyrosequencing is an highly efficient tool for investigating the colonization of new environments by alien species, and for ecological and adaptive studies coupled with biological detection methods. This study represents the first application of pyrosequencing for describing Phytophthoras in environmental soil samples.},

	abstract = {The {rDNA} internal transcribed spacer ({ITS}) region has been accepted as a {DNA} barcoding marker for fungi and is widely used in phylogenetic studies; however, intragenomic {ITS} variability has been observed in a broad range of taxa, including prokaryotes, plants, animals, and fungi, and this variability has the potential to inflate species richness estimates in molecular investigations of environmental samples. In this study 454 amplicon pyrosequencing of the {ITS}1 region was applied to 99 phylogenetically diverse axenic single-spore cultures of fungi (Dikarya: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) to investigate levels of intragenomic variation. Three species (one Basidiomycota and two Ascomycota), in addition to a positive control species known to contain {ITS} paralogs, displayed levels of molecular variation indicative of intragenomic variation; taxon inflation due to presumed intragenomic variation was ≈9\%. Intragenomic variability in the {ITS} region appears to be widespread but relatively rare in fungi (≈3–5\% of species investigated in this study), suggesting this problem may have minor impacts on species richness estimates relative to {PCR} and/or pyrosequencing errors. Our results indicate that 454 amplicon pyrosequencing represents a powerful tool for investigating levels of {ITS} intragenomic variability across taxa, which may be valuable for better understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying concerted evolution of repetitive {DNA} regions.},

	abstract = {An accurate reconstruction of the eukaryotic tree of life is essential to identify the innovations underlying the diversity of microbial and macroscopic (e.g., plants and animals) eukaryotes. Previous work has divided eukaryotic diversity into a small number of high-level “supergroups,” many of which receive strong support in phylogenomic analyses. However, the abundance of data in phylogenomic analyses can lead to highly supported but incorrect relationships due to systematic phylogenetic error. Furthermore, the paucity of major eukaryotic lineages (19 or fewer) included in these genomic studies may exaggerate systematic error and reduce power to evaluate hypotheses. Here, we use a taxon-rich strategy to assess eukaryotic relationships. We show that analyses emphasizing broad taxonomic sampling (up to 451 taxa representing 72 major lineages) combined with a moderate number of genes yield a well-resolved eukaryotic tree of life. The consistency across analyses with varying numbers of taxa (88–451) and levels of missing data (17–69\%) supports the accuracy of the resulting topologies. The resulting stable topology emerges without the removal of rapidly evolving genes or taxa, a practice common to phylogenomic analyses. Several major groups are stable and strongly supported in these analyses (e.g., {SAR}, Rhizaria, Excavata), whereas the proposed supergroup “Chromalveolata” is rejected. Furthermore, extensive instability among photosynthetic lineages suggests the presence of systematic biases including endosymbiotic gene transfer from symbiont (nucleus or plastid) to host. Our analyses demonstrate that stable topologies of ancient evolutionary relationships can be achieved with broad taxonomic sampling and a moderate number of genes. Finally, taxon-rich analyses such as presented here provide a method for testing the accuracy of relationships that receive high bootstrap support ({BS}) in phylogenomic analyses and enable placement of the multitude of lineages that lack genome scale data.},

We detected no significant differences in soil fungal diversity and community structure associated with different plant cultivars. However, {DNA}-based analyses yielded lower fungal {OTU} richness as compared to {RNA}-based analyses. Clear differences in fungal community structure were also observed in relation to sampling time and the nucleic acid pool targeted ({DNA} versus {RNA}). The most abundant soil fungi, as recovered by {DNA}-based methods, did not necessary represent the most “active” fungi (as recovered via {RNA}). Interestingly, {RNA}-derived community compositions at t1 were highly similar to {DNA}-derived communities at t2, based on presence/absence measures of {OTUs}. We recovered large proportions of fungal sequences belonging to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Basidiomycota, especially at the {RNA} level, suggesting that these important and potentially beneficial fungi are not affected by the plant cultivars nor by {GM} traits (Bt toxin production). Our results suggest that even though {DNA}- and {RNA}-derived soil fungal communities can be very different at a given time, {RNA} composition may have a predictive power of fungal community development through time.},

Several reports based solely on morphological observations have postulated that there is an intimate link between endophytes and saprotrophs. This study aims to provide valuable insight as to whether some endophytic fungi manifest themselves as saprotrophs upon host decay. Ribosomal {DNA}-based sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationships from 99 fungal isolates (endophytes, mycelia sterilia, and saprotrophs) recovered from leaves and twigs of Magnolia liliifera were investigated in this study. Molecular data suggest there are fungal taxa that possibly exist as endophytes and saprotrophs. Isolates of Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, and Phomopsis, which are common plant endophytes, have high sequence similarity and are phylogenetically related to their saprotrophic counterparts. This provides evidence to suggest that some endophytic species change their ecological strategies and adopt a saprotrophic lifestyle. The implication of these findings on fungal biodiversity and host specificity is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Clonality is a common phenomenon in plants, allowing genets to persist asexually for much longer periods of time than ramets. The relative frequency of sexual vs. asexual reproduction determines long-term dominance and persistence of clonal plants at the landscape scale. One of the most familiar and valued clonal plants in North America is aspen (Populus tremuloides). Previous researchers have suggested that aspen in xeric landscapes of the intermountain west represent genets of great chronological age, maintained via clonal expansion in the near absence of sexual reproduction. We synthesized microsatellite data from 1371 ramets in two large sampling grids in Utah. We found a surprisingly large number of distinct genets, some covering large spatial areas, but most represented by only one to a few individual ramets at a sampling scale of 50 m. In general, multi-ramet genets were spatially cohesive, although some genets appear to be fragmented remnants of much larger clones. We conclude that recent sexual reproduction in these landscapes is a stronger contributor to standing genetic variation at the population level than the accumulation of somatic mutations, and that even some of the spatially large clones may not be as ancient as previously supposed. Further, a striking majority of the largest genets in both study areas had three alleles at one or more loci, suggesting triploidy or aneuploidy. These genets tended to be spatially clustered but not closely related. Together, these findings substantially advance our understanding of clonal dynamics in western North American aspen, and set the stage for a broad range of future studies.},
